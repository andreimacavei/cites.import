Paragraph 203. We recognize the important role of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), an international agreement that stands at the intersection between trade, environment and development; promotes the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; should contribute to tangible benefits for local people; and ensures that no species entering into international trade is threatened with extinction. We recognize the economic, social and environmental impacts of illicit trafficking in wildlife where firm and strengthened action needs to be taken on both the supply and demand sides. In this regard, we emphasize the importance of effective international cooperation among relevant multilateral environmental agreements and international organizations. We further stress the importance of basing the listing of species on agreed criteria. </p> <!-- end #milieu --></div>",

It entered into force after ratification or accession by 10 States, on 1 July 1975. </p> <p> Since then, the number of countries that have ratified, approved, accepted or acceded to the Convention has continued to increase. With 178 Parties, CITES is widely regarded as one of the most important international conservation instruments. During this period, the Conference of the Parties has shown itself to be capable of adapting to changing circumstances and, through the adoption of Resolutions and Decisions, has demonstrated an ability to construct practical solutions to increasingly complex wildlife trade and conservation problems. </p> <p> At its ninth meeting (Fort Lauderdale, 1994), the Conference of the Parties commissioned a review of the Convention's effectiveness. The principal purposes of the review were to evaluate the extent to which the Convention had achieved its objectives and the progress made since CITES came into being and, most importantly, to identify deficiencies and requirements necessary to strengthen the Convention and help plan for the future. At its 10th meeting (Harare, 1997), the Conference agreed to an Action Plan for implementing certain findings and recommendations of the review. A central finding was the need for a strategic plan and, at its 11th meeting (Gigiri, 2000), the Conference of the Parties adopted the Strategic Vision through 2005, and an Action Plan. </p> <p> At its 13th meeting (Bangkok, 2004), the Conference of the Parties adopted Decision 13.1, which extended the validity of the Strategic Vision and Action Plan until the end of 2007. It also established a procedure for developing a new Strategic Vision through 2013, particularly to contribute to the achievement of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) target of significantly reducing the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. The present document is the result of this process. </p> <p> At its 16th meeting (Bangkok, 2013), the Conference of the Parties extended the validity of the Strategic Vision and Action Plan to 2020 and included amendments to contribute to the achievement of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the relevant Aichi Biodiversity Targets adopted by the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, and to the relevant outcomes of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. </p> <p> With this new Strategic Vision, the Conference of the Parties to CITES outlines the Convention&rsquo;s direction in the new millennium and takes into account, within the context of its mandate, issues such as: </p> <blockquote> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contributing to the UN Millennium Development Goals relevant to CITES; </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contributing to the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the implementation of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets adopted by the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, to the extent that they are relevant to CITES; </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contributing to the implementation of the relevant outcomes of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (2012); </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contributing to the conservation of wildlife as an integral part of the global ecosystem on which all life depends; </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cultural, social and economic factors at play in producer and consumer countries; </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; promoting transparency and wider involvement of civil society in the development of conservation policies and practices; and </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ensuring that a coherent and internationally agreed approach based on scientific evidence is taken to address any species of wild fauna and flora subject to unsustainable international trade. </p> </blockquote> <p> <strong> <em> Purpose </em> </strong> </p> <p> The twofold purpose of the Strategic Vision is: </p> <blockquote> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to improve the working of the Convention, so that international trade in wild fauna and flora is conducted at sustainable levels; and </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to ensure that CITES policy developments are mutually supportive of international environmental priorities and take into account new international initiatives, consistent with the terms of the Convention. </p> </blockquote> <p> <strong> <em> Structure </em> </strong> </p> <p> In order to achieve this purpose, three broad goals, of equal priority, have been identified as the key components of the Strategic Vision: </p> <blockquote> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong> Goal 1 </strong> :&nbsp; Ensure compliance with and implementation and enforcement of the Convention. </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong> Goal 2 </strong> :&nbsp; Secure the necessary financial resources and means for the operation and implementation of the Convention. </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong> Goal 3 </strong> :&nbsp; Contribute to significantly reducing the rate of biodiversity loss and to achieving relevant globally-agreed goals and targets by ensuring that CITES and other multilateral instruments and processes are coherent and mutually supportive. </p> </blockquote> <p> The goals aim at consolidating the existing strengths of CITES, ensuring the implementation of the mandate of the Convention, and further improving the relationship with relevant multilateral environmental agreements and related conventions, agreements and associations. </p> <p> Within the framework provided by each of these goals, this Strategic Vision identifies a number of objectives to be achieved. Corresponding indicators of progress are to be developed by the Standing Committee and reviewed by the Conference of the Parties. </p> <p> This document provides a framework for the future development of the existing body of Resolutions and Decisions. While it should provide guidance on how the goals and objectives are to be achieved, the Conference of the Parties, the Committees or the Secretariat, as appropriate, will take required action. The document also serves the Parties as a tool for the prioritization of activities, and decisions on how best to fund them, in light of the need for the rational application of costs and the efficient and transparent use of resources. </p> <p> It should be noted that all references to 'trade' in the Strategic Vision refer to trade as defined in Article I of the Convention. </p> <table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"khaki\"> <tr> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"639\"> <div> <p align=\"center\"> <strong> CITES vision statement </strong> </p> <p> Conserve biodiversity and contribute to its sustainable use by ensuring that no species of wild fauna or flora becomes or remains subject to unsustainable exploitation through international trade, thereby contributing to the significant reduction of the rate of biodiversity loss and making a significant contribution towards achieving the relevant <em> Aichi Biodiversity Targets </em> . <u> </u> </p> </div> </td> </tr> </table> <div> </div> <p class=\"mbc\"> THE STRATEGIC GOALS </p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"95%\"> <tr> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"17%\"> <em> <strong> GOAL 1&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> </em> </td> <td width=\"83%\"> <em> <strong> ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH AND IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE CONVENTION </strong> </em> </td> </tr> </table> <p> <strong> Introduction </strong> </p> <p> The effectiveness of the Convention depends upon its full implementation by all Parties, whether they are consumers or producers of wild animals and plants.

</p> <p> NOTING that these two documents were prepared by the Working Group on CITES and Livelihoods (information document CoP16 Inf. 21); </p> <p> RECOGNIZING that CITES-listing decisions are neither the sole cause of nor the sole solution to the livelihood problems of the rural communities <a href=\"#FN1\"> <sup> 1 </sup> </a> <a name=\"1\"> </a> , but that the effective implementation of such decisions can form part of a strategy to provide sustainable livelihoods for rural communities, consistent with paragraph&nbsp;203 of the outcome document of the Rio+20 Conference <em> The Future We Want </em> ; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING that poor rural communities may attach economic, social, cultural and ceremonial importance to some CITES-listed species; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING that the implementation of CITES is better achieved with the engagement of rural communities, especially those which are traditionally dependent on CITES-listed species for their livelihoods; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING that the implementation of CITES listings may enhance livelihoods by delivering long-term species conservation and reducing unsustainable and illegal trade; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING ALSO that implementation of some listings (particularly Appendix-I listings) may impact livelihoods of rural communities by restricting access to income, employment and other resources, such as food, materials and medicines, but that it need not always do so if appropriate implementation strategies are adopted; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING that livelihoods issues and the present Resolution do not pertain to the criteria for the amendment of the Appendices or the requirement to make non-detriment findings; </p> <p class=\"mbc\"> THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE CONVENTION </p> <p> RECOMMENDS the following to be considered when Parties address livelihood issues: </p> <p> <strong> <em> Regarding empowerment of rural communities </em> </strong> </p> <p> ENCOURAGES Parties to work with key stakeholder groups to design, implement and monitor effective strategies with regard to the implementation of CITES listings, recognizing that: </p> <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Scientific Authorities should consider whether the species would be maintained throughout its range at a level consistent with its role in the ecosystems in which it occurs; </p> <p> iii)&nbsp;&nbsp; in making a non-detriment finding, Scientific Authorities should consider the volume of legal and illegal trade (known, inferred, projected, estimated) relative to the vulnerability of the species (intrinsic and extrinsic factors that increase the risk of extinction of the species); </p> <p> iv)&nbsp;&nbsp; the data requirements for a determination that trade is not detrimental to the survival of the species should be proportionate to the vulnerability of the species concerned; </p> <p> v)&nbsp;&nbsp; the making of an effective non-detriment finding relies upon a correct identification of the species concerned and verification that it is specimens of this species that are to be exported; </p> <p> vi)&nbsp;&nbsp; the methodology used to make a non-detriment finding should reflect the origin and type of specimen, such that the method used to make a non-detriment finding for a specimen known to be of non-wild origin may be less rigorous than that for a specimen of wild origin for example; </p> <p> vii)&nbsp;&nbsp; the methodology used should be flexible enough to allow for consideration of the specific and individual characteristics of different taxa; </p> <p> viii)&nbsp;&nbsp; the implementation of adaptive management, including monitoring, is an important consideration in the making of a non-detriment finding; </p> <p> ix)&nbsp;&nbsp; the non-detriment finding is based on resource assessment methodologies which may include, but are not limited to, consideration of: </p> <dir> <p> A.&nbsp;&nbsp; species biology and life-history characteristics;

Such matters are considered and ensuing compliance measures are applied in a fair, consistent and transparent manner. </p> <p> 6.Generally, findings, reports and communications in compliance matters are not treated confidentially. </p> <p> However, communications between the Secretariat and individual Parties on specific compliance matters are generally confidential. </p> <p> 7.Decisions on whether to close or keep open debates in compliance matters are taken according to the Rules of Procedure of the body considering the matter and generally reasons are given. </p> <p> 8.The Secretariat communicates compliance-related decisions to the relevant authorities. </p> <p> <strong> <em> The various bodies and their compliance-related tasks </em> </strong> </p> <p> 9.Compliance matters are handled by the following CITES bodies. Their main compliance-related tasks are listed below. </p> <p> 10.The Conference of the Parties: </p> <dir> <p> a)provides general policy guidance on compliance issues; </p> <p> b)directs and oversees the handling of compliance matters particularly through the identification of key obligations and procedures; </p> <p> c)reviews as needed decisions of the Standing Committee related to specific compliance matters; and </p> <p> d)may delegate certain authority to the Standing Committee or other CITES bodies in accordance with the Convention. </p> </dir> <p> 11.When the Conference of the Parties decides to carry out itself the tasks delegated to the Standing Committee, it follows the same procedures as those described below for the Standing Committee. </p> <p> 12.The Standing Committee, acting in accordance with instructions from and authority delegated by the Conference of the Parties, handles general and specific compliance matters, including: </p> <dir> <p> a)monitoring and assessing overall compliance with obligations under the Convention; </p> <p> b)advising and assisting Parties in complying with obligations under the Convention; </p> <p> c)verifying information; and </p> <p> d)taking compliance measures as described below. </p> </dir> <p> 13.The Animals and Plants Committees, acting in accordance with instructions from and authority delegated by the Conference of the Parties, advise and assist the Standing Committee and the Conference of the Parties with regard to compliance matters, <i> inter alia </i> , by undertaking necessary reviews, consultations, assessments and reporting. These Committees are entrusted with specific tasks in the handling of matters related to the Review of Significant Trade. </p> 14.The Secretariat: <dir> <p> a)assists and supports the Animals and Plants Committees, the Standing Committee and the Conference of the Parties in carrying out their functions concerning compliance matters as described in this Guide and, where applicable, according to the procedures set out in relevant Resolutions and Decisions; </p> <p> b)receives, assesses and communicates to the Parties information on compliance matters; </p> <p> c)advises and assists Parties in complying with obligations under the Convention; </p> <p> d)makes recommendations for achieving compliance; and </p> <p> e)monitors the implementation of compliance-related decisions. </p> </dir> <b> <i> <p> Handling of specific compliance matters </p> </i> </b> <p> <em> A.Identification of potential compliance matters </em> </p> 15.Annual and biennial reports, legislative texts as well as other special reports and responses to information requests, for example within the Review of Significant Trade or the National Legislation Project, provide the primary, but not exclusive, means of monitoring compliance with obligations under the Convention. <p> 16.The Secretariat provides a Party concerned with information it receives about that Partys compliance, and communicates with the Party regarding this matter. </p> <p> 17.In response, the Party informs the Secretariat as soon as possible of any relevant facts in so far as its laws permit and, where appropriate, proposes remedial action. Where the Party considers that an inquiry is desirable, such inquiry may be carried out by one or more persons expressly authorized by the Party. </p> <p> 18.Any Party concerned over matters related to trade in specimens of CITES-listed species by another Party may bring the matter up directly with that Party and/or call upon the Secretariat for assistance. </p> <p> 19.Parties themselves are encouraged to give the Secretariat early warning of any compliance matter, including the inability to provide information by a certain deadline, and indicate the reasons and any need for assistance. </p> <p> 20.Where compliance matters are identified, the Parties concerned are given every opportunity to correct them within reasonable time limits, if necessary with the assistance of the Secretariat. </p> <p> <em> B.Consideration of compliance matters </em> </p> <p> 21.If the Party fails to take sufficient remedial action within a reasonable time limit, the compliance matter is brought to the attention of the Standing Committee by the Secretariat, in direct contact with the Party concerned. </p> <p> 22.If a compliance matter is otherwise brought to the attention of the Standing Committee in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, the Standing Committee: </p> <dir> <p> a)refers the matter to the Secretariat for action according to the procedure in paragraphs 16-20 above; or </p> <p> b)rejects it as trivial or ill-founded; or </p> <p> c)in exceptional circumstances, after consultation with the Party concerned, follows the procedures as described below. </p> </dir> <p> 23.When compliance matters are brought to the attention of the Standing Committee, it is generally done in writing and includes details as to which specific obligations are concerned and an assessment of the reasons why the Party concerned may be unable to meet those obligations. </p> <p> 24.When a compliance matter is brought to the attention of the Standing Committee, the Secretariat immediately informs the Party or Parties concerned. </p> <p> 25.The Standing Committee rejects compliance matters which it considers are trivial or ill-founded. </p> <p> Where the Standing Committee has decided that the submission is not trivial or ill-founded, the Party concerned is given the opportunity to provide comments within a reasonable time limit. </p> <p> 26.The Standing Committee decides whether to gather or request further information on a compliance matter whenever such information may be found and whether to seek an invitation from the Party concerned to undertake the gathering and verification of information in the territory of that Party or wherever such information may be found. </p> <p> 27.The Party concerned has the right to participate in discussions with respect to its own compliance, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the relevant body. </p> <p> 28.If a Party cannot access the financial resources needed to participate in CITES meetings where its own compliance is being considered, it is able to request assistance from the Secretariat or the Standing Committee in identifying such resources. </p> <p> <em> C.Measures to achieve compliance </em> </p> <p> 29.If a compliance matter has not been resolved, the Standing Committee decides to take one or more of the following measures: </p> <dir> <p> a)provide advice, information and appropriate facilitation of assistance and other capacity-building support to the Party concerned; </p> <p> b)request special reporting from the Party concerned; </p> <p> c)issue a written caution, requesting a response and offering assistance; </p> <p> d)recommend specific capacity-building actions to be undertaken by the Party concerned; </p> <p> e)provide in-country assistance, technical assessment and a verification mission, upon the invitation of the Party concerned; </p> <p> f)send a public notification of a compliance matter through the Secretariat to all Parties advising that compliance matters have been brought to the attention of a Party and that, up to that time, there has been no satisfactory response or action; </p> <p> g)issue a warning to the Party concerned that it is in non-compliance, e.g. in relation to national reporting and/or the National Legislation Project; and </p> <p> h)request a compliance action plan to be submitted to the Standing Committee by the Party concerned identifying appropriate steps, a timetable for when those steps should be completed and means to assess satisfactory completion. </p> </dir> <p> 30.In certain cases, the Standing Committee decides to recommend the suspension of commercial or all trade in specimens of one or more CITES-listed species, consistent with the Convention. Such a recommendation may be made in cases where a Partys compliance matter is unresolved and persistent and the Party is showing no intention to achieve compliance or a State not a Party is not issuing the documentation referred to in Article X of the Convention. Such a recommendation is always specifically and explicitly based on the Convention and on any applicable Resolutions and Decisions of the Conference of the Parties <sup> <a href=\"#1\"> 1 </a> </sup> . <a name=\"res\"> </a> <p> 31.The list of measures above is not necessarily an exhaustive list of measures applied to date. </p> <p> 32.When the Standing Committee decides upon one or more of the measures mentioned above, it takes into account: </p> <dir> <p> a)the capacity of the Party concerned, especially developing countries, and in particular the least developed and small island developing States and Parties with economies in transition; </p> <p> b)such factors as the cause, type, degree and frequency of the compliance matters; </p> <p> c)the appropriateness of the measures so that they are commensurate with the gravity of the compliance matter; and </p> <p> d)the possible impact on conservation and sustainable use with a view to avoiding negative results. </p> </dir> <p> These considerations are clearly set out in the Standing Committees recommendations. </p> <i> <p> D.Monitoring and implementation of measures to achieve compliance </p> </i> <p> 33.The Standing Committee, with the assistance of the Secretariat, monitors the actions taken by the Party concerned to implement measures taken. In this regard, the Standing Committee may, <i> inter alia </i> : </p> <dir> <p> a)request the Party concerned to submit progress reports in accordance with a schedule; and </p> <p> b)arrange, upon the invitation of the Party concerned, for an in-country technical assessment and for a verification mission. </p> </dir> <p> In the light of progress, the Standing Committee decides whether to adjust the measures it has taken, or to take other measures. </p> <p> 34.Existing recommendations to suspend trade are generally reviewed at each Standing Committee meeting. They are also monitored intersessionally by the Secretariat. A recommendation to suspend trade is withdrawn as soon as the compliance matter has been resolved or sufficient progress has been made. The Secretariat notifies Parties of any such withdrawal as soon as possible. </p> <p> 35.The general guidelines in paragraphs 33 and 34 above are in some cases supplemented by more precise provisions regarding specific categories of compliance matters, e.g. in the case of significant trade in specimens of Appendix-II species, as laid out in the Resolutions and Decisions related thereto. </p> <p> <strong> <em> Reporting and reviews </em> </strong> </p> <p> 36.The Standing Committee reports to the Conference of the Parties on compliance matters. The Secretariat reports to the Standing Committee and the Conference of the Parties on compliance matters. </p> <p> 37.The Conference of the Parties may review this document periodically and revise it where appropriate. </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> <p> <img height=\"1\" src=\"/I/grey_dot.gif\" width=\"280\"/> </p> <a href=\"#0\"> * </a> <a name=\"FN0\"> </a> <span class=\"footnote\"> Corrected by the Secretariat following the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties. </span> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"table_s\" width=\"80%\"> <tr> <p> <td class=\"small\" valign=\"top\" width=\"3%\"> <a href=\"#res\"> 1 </a> </td> <td class=\"small\" width=\"97%\"> <span class=\"small\"> <em> These currently include: <br> &ndash; Resolution Conf. 11.17 (Rev.

CoP15) <a href=\"#FN0\"> * </a> <a name=\"0\"> </a> </h1> <p class=\"headblack\"> Management of nationally established export quotas </p> <p> CONVINCED that nationally established export quotas for Appendix-II species are important tools to assist in regulating and monitoring wildlife trade to ensure that the use of natural resources remains sustainable; <p> NOTING that, for many Parties, export quotas are used as an essential management tool in the conservation of species of wild fauna and flora; <p> RECOGNIZING however that the use and implementation of export quotas are not described in detail either in the text of the Convention or in any text adopted by the Conference of the Parties, but that it is desirable that all Parties have a common understanding of the way in which such quotas should be managed at the national and international levels; <p> CONSIDERING that exporting and importing countries share a responsibility to ensure that export quotas are respected; <p align=\"center\"> <strong> THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE CONVENTION </strong> <p> RECOMMENDS that Parties follow the <em> Guidelines for management of nationally established export quotas </em> that are annexed to this Resolution. </p> <p> </p> <hr align=\"left\" color=\"#339900\" noshade size=\"1\" width=\"100%\"> <p> <strong> Annex </strong> <p class=\"headblack\"> Guidelines for management of nationally established export quotas </p> <p> <em> <strong> Introduction </strong> </em> </p> <p> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This document specifies a number of general principles regarding the establishment and management of annual export quotas at the national level in the context of CITES. It is understood that there may be exceptions and reasons for departing from these general principles in certain cases. In particular, it should be noted that certain exceptions may be found in Resolutions of the Conference of the Parties, which take precedence over these guidelines. <p> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the context of CITES, an annual export quota is a limit on the number or quantity of specimens of a particular species that may be exported from the country concerned within a 12-month period. An annual export quota is not a target and there is no need for a quota to be fully used. It is recognized that there are some cases in which it is likely that the export of specimens removed from the wild will occur after the year in which the removal took place, as happens with hunting trophies. <p> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An export quota system is a management tool, used to ensure that exports of specimens of a certain species are maintained at a level that has no detrimental effect on the population of the species. The setting of an export quota advised by a Scientific Authority effectively meets the requirement of CITES to make a non-detriment finding for species included in Appendix I or II and, for species in Appendix II, to ensure that the species is maintained throughout its range at a level consistent with its role in the ecosystems in which it occurs. </p> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A well-implemented export quota system can be an advantage for any Party to CITES that authorizes exports. It eliminates the need for a non-detriment finding for each individual shipment of CITES specimens, provides a basis for monitoring the trade and may facilitate the issuance of export permits. In the case of species whose populations span international borders, the establishment of export quotas can be coordinated at a regional level, which is of particular relevance in the case of migratory species. <p> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be recognized, however, that there are also other management tools that may be better suited to the biological, administrative or other management context. In some cases, the use of quotas could have an undesirable effect, particularly if they are not adjusted as necessary to take into account changing biological, legal or administrative needs. For example, where a quota has been set for a particular year but the species is impacted by climatic factors, such as a drought, there could still be pressure to fill the quota. <p> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fundamental principle to follow is that decision-making regarding the level of sustainable exports must be scientifically based, and harvests managed in the most appropriate manner. This requires that implementation, including administrative, legislative and enforcement measures, take account of the regulatory and biological context. <p> 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contexts where the establishment of an export quota would be the most effective management tool, it is important that the use of that tool is not made less attractive to exporting countries by the imposition of unnecessary administrative layers. For this reason, the guidelines in this document have been prepared with the thought in mind that they need to be practical and uncomplicated, and not to add to the existing administrative burdens. <p> <strong> <em> Establishment of national export quotas </em> </strong> </p> <p> 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where export quotas have not already been agreed at the international level (e.g. by the Conference of the Parties), Parties are encouraged to establish national export quotas for CITES-listed species whenever this is relevant to the management and conservation of the species concerned. <p> 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as possible the period covered by an export quota should be the calendar year (i.e. 1&nbsp;January to 31 December). <p> 10.&nbsp; When export quotas are established, they should be set as a result of a non-detriment finding by a Scientific Authority, in accordance with Article III, paragraph&nbsp;2&nbsp;(a), or Article&nbsp;IV, paragraph&nbsp;2&nbsp;(a), of the Convention, and should ensure that the species is maintained throughout its range at a level consistent with its role in the ecosystems in which it occurs, in accordance with Article&nbsp;IV, paragraph&nbsp;3. Export quotas for wild-taken specimens should be set at a level that takes account of the number or quantity of specimens that are taken from the wild legally or illegally. A non-detriment finding should be made whenever an export quota is established for the first time or revised, and reviewed annually. <p> 11.&nbsp; Export quotas are usually established for specimens of wild source. However, separate quotas may be established for specimens of different sources (e.g. wild-taken, ranched, captive-bred, artificially propagated). An export quota applies to wild-taken specimens unless indicated otherwise. A non-detriment finding that supports the export of specimens of any specific source (e.g. ranching) should not be relied upon to authorize the export of specimens of other sources. </p> 12.&nbsp; Export quotas are usually established for a specific number or quantity of animals or plants. However, they may be established for certain types of parts or derivatives (e.g. elephant tusks, caviar, skins, bark, sawn wood, bulbs). <p> 13.To indicate the species for which quotas have been set, Parties should use the names indicated in the standard nomenclatures adopted by the Conference of the Parties <a class=\"small\" href=\"#FN1\"> <sup> 1 </sup> </a> <a name=\"1\"> </a> . The approved names can be found in the most recent edition of the <i> Checklist of CITES Species </i> , which is updated after each meeting of the Conference of the Parties <a class=\"small\" href=\"#FN2\"> <sup> 2 </sup> </a> . <a name=\"2\"> </a> . </p> <p> 14.Terms used to define or clarify a quota (such as those indicating the type or source, when appropriate, of specimens to which the quota applies) should be used in accordance with agreed definitions contained in Resolutions of the Conference of the Parties or follow the guidance provided in the most recent edition of the <i> Guidelines for the preparation and submission of CITES annual reports </i> <a name=\"3\"> </a> <a class=\"small\" href=\"#FN3\"> <sup> 3 </sup> </a> . </p> <p> <strong> <em> Communication of nationally established export quotas </em> </strong> </p> <p> 15.&nbsp; In accordance with Resolution Conf.&nbsp;12.3 (Rev.&nbsp;CoP15), Parties should inform the CITES Secretariat of their nationally established export quotas and of revisions of such quotas. Such information can be provided at any time but, as far as possible, should be communicated at least 30 days before the start of the period to which the export quota relates. <p> 16.&nbsp; If a Party establishes an annual export quota for a period other than a calendar year, it should indicate the period to which the quota applies when communicating it to the Secretariat. <p> 17.&nbsp; When the Secretariat is informed about export quotas or revisions, it should publish them on the CITES website as soon as possible after they are received, with an indication of the date of publication. The publication should normally take place within 30 days of receipt. <p> 18.&nbsp; When the Secretariat receives information about a quota for publication and it appears that there are technical problems, or it has questions about technical or administrative aspects of the quota needing clarification (for example, the standard nomenclature is not followed, there is an incoherence between the quota and available information on the species, past quotas have been regularly exceeded, etc.), it should discuss these with the Party concerned before placing the quota on the CITES website. In such cases the Secretariat and the Parties concerned should try to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Once it is resolved, the Secretariat should promptly publish the quota on its website. If the case is not resolved, the Secretariat shall publish the quota with an annotation to indicate its concerns and the issue will be taken up through one of the existing CITES procedures. </p> 19.&nbsp; If any Party is concerned that a published quota may be too high, it should consult the appropriate Management Authority of the Party that established the quota regarding its concerns, in accordance with Resolution Conf.&nbsp;11.18 on <a href=\"http://www.cites.org/eng/res/11/11-18.shtml\"> <em> Trade in Appendix-II and -III species </em> </a> . <p> <strong> <em> Quotas not fully utilized in a particular year </em> </strong> </p> <p> 20.&nbsp; The level of an export quota reflects the number or quantity of specimens of a species that may be exported in any particular year (the specimens having been removed from the wild, bred in captivity, artificially propagated, etc., in that year). It sometimes happens, however, that, although specimens are obtained for export, it is not possible to ship them in the year in which they were obtained. </p> 21.&nbsp; A Party may decide exceptionally to authorize export in one year of specimens that were obtained in a previous year, and under the quota for that previous year. In such cases, the quota for the current year should not be increased in order to include the specimens obtained in the previous year. Rather the number or quantity of such specimens that will be exported should be deducted from the quota of the previous year. <p> <strong> <em> Monitoring and trade reporting </em> </strong> </p> <p> 22.&nbsp; Every Party that has established an export quota is responsible for monitoring its use and must ensure that it is not exceeded. For that purpose, it should maintain data on the number or quantity of specimens actually exported, to be used as a reference when reviewing applications to authorize further exports. </p> 23.&nbsp; The data from national annual reports of Parties are stored in the CITES trade database that is maintained by the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre under contract to the CITES Secretariat. This database provides the basis for monitoring the trade and the implementation of the export quotas at the international level. <p> &nbsp; </p> <p> <img height=\"1\" src=\"/I/grey_dot.gif\" width=\"280\"/> </p> <p> <a name=\"FN0\"> </a> <a href=\"#0\"> * </a> <span class=\"footnote\"> <em> Amended at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties. </em> </span> <p> <span class=\"small\"> <a href=\"#1\"> <sup> 1 </sup> </a> <a name=\"FN1\"> </a> <em class=\"footnote\"> The most recent list of adopted nomenclatural references is contained in Resolution Conf. 12.11 (Rev.

Whereas CBD provides general guidance to Parties on how to address a broad range of biodiversity issues through national implementation, CITES is regulatory in nature, species-specific, and focuses on international trade in wildlife. </p> <p> 2. Although CITES does not have a definition of sustainable use, the case studies show that the elements of the <em> Addis Ababa Principles and Guidelines for the Sustainable Use of Biodiversity </em> that are generally relevant to CITES are either already implicit in the language of CITES or are promoted by CITES. This for instance, refers to practical Principles 1, 2, 4, 7, 9 and 12, elements of which are incorporated in the <em> Checklist to assist in making non-detriment findings for Appendix-II exports </em> . </p> <p> 3. From the case studies presented at the joint session of the 16th meeting of the Plants Committee and 22nd meeting of the Animals Committee (Lima, July 2006), it is evident that the Addis Ababa Principles and Guidelines are not always immediately applicable to the decision-making process under CITES, particularly with respect to making non-detriment findings (NDF). </p> <p> 4. It is recognized that the Addis Ababa Principles and Guidelines are, on a case-by-case basis, relevant to the work of CITES (in addition to the Principles referred to in paragraph 3, e.g. Principles 5, 6, 8, 11), and may be considered for possible development of further taxa-specific NDF guidelines. </p> <p> 5. The Animals and Plants Committees propose the amendment of Resolution Conf. 10.4 (Rev. CoP14) to acknowledge the use of the <em> Addis Ababa Principles and Guidelines for the Sustainable Use of Biodiversity </em> as a voluntary additional tool that can be used in making NDFs. </p> <p> 6. Additionally, questions were raised concerning the work still required by the scientific committees on this matter, and the possible complications of using socio-economic aspects of the Addis Ababa Principles and Guidelines in the making of non-detrimental findings. </p> <p> 7. It was further noted that the Addis Ababa Principles and Guidelines could support the existing IUCN guidance for the making of non-detrimental findings, and would be valuable for the development of taxa-specific guidelines in this regard, for instance for tree species. </p> <p> 8. Finally it was recognized that the Addis Ababa Principles and Guidelines, which had been developed over many years and received broad international support, were of global importance but that not all principles were of relevance to CITES. </p> </dir> <p> &nbsp; </p> <p> <img height=\"1\" src=\"../../../I/grey_dot.gif\" width=\"220\"/> </p> <p> <a href=\"#0\"> * </a> <a name=\"FN0\"> </a> <span class=\"footnote\"> Amended at the 14th meetings of the Conference of the Parties. </span> </p> <!-- end #milieu --> </hr> </hr></div>",

</p> <p> CONCERNED that wild populations of great apes [all species of gorilla ( <em> Gorilla </em> spp.) <em> , </em> chimpanzee ( <em> Pan </em> spp.)and orang-utan ( <em> Pongo </em> spp.)] in Africa and Asia are threatened by the combined effects of trade in live animals, poaching for bushmeat, disease and habitat loss caused by disturbance, fragmentation and destruction; </p> <p> CONCERNED that almost all great ape populations continue to decline drastically; </p> <p> AWARE that chimpanzees are now reported to be extinct in one, and possibly in three more, of the 25 countries they once inhabited, that the Sumatran orang-utan ( <em> Pongo abelii </em> )and three subspecies of gorilla are classified by IUCN as &lsquo;Critically Endangered&rsquo; and that the other species and subspecies of great apes are classified as &lsquo;Endangered&rsquo;; </p> <p> RECALLING that all great ape species are included in Appendix&nbsp;I of the Convention; </p> <p> CONCERNED that illegal trade at international and national levels has been stimulated by opening up of forest habitats, increasing demand for ape meat, especially from urban populations both in range and non-range States and continuing global demand for live specimens, particularly juveniles; </p> <p> COMMENDING efforts already made in a number of range and non-range States to tackle poaching and illegal trade, including repatriation of seized live specimens to the country of origin; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING the need for international support to assist the 23 range States in protecting great ape populations, their habitats and related biodiversity resources; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING also the need for technical guidance to assist all Parties in preventing illegal trade in live specimens and parts and derivatives of great apes, including the confiscation and subsequent treatment of live animals; </p> <p> NOTING that the World Summit on Sustainable Development Great Ape Survival Partnership (WSSD GRASP) led by UNEP and UNESCO draws on the scientific expertise of the GRASP Scientific Commission, which includes members of both the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) and the International Primatological Society (IPS), and brings together range and non-range States, international conventions (including CITES and the Convention on Biological Diversity), and a range of global and national non governmental organizations;

Appendix-I specimens may be acquired from other countries, but they must be imported home under the conditions of Article III or other paragraphs in Article VII. </p> <p> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article VII, paragraph 3 (b), excludes Appendix-II specimens from this exemption when the specimen has been acquired outside the person&rsquo;s country of usual residence, in a country where removal from the wild occurred AND where that country requires an export permit. </p> <p> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parties can choose to apply stricter domestic measures such that any country of import or export can exclude specimens from the personal and household effects exemption, establish quantitative restrictions or choose not to implement the exemption at all. </p> <p> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is recommended in Resolution Conf. 13.7 (Rev. CoP16) that Parties report whether or not they implement Article VII, paragraph 3, in domestic legislation. </p> <p> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parties should consult the Secretariat&rsquo;s website for Parties that implement the exemption. </p> <p> 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parties may establish quantitative limits for Appendix-II species by following the guidelines in Annex 2 to Resolution Conf. 13.7 (Rev. CoP16). </p> <p> Definition of &lsquo;personal and household effects&rsquo; </p> <p> 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specimens must be personally owned or possessed for non-commercial purposes. This excludes use for commercial gain, sale, and display for commercial purposes, keeping for sale, offering for sale or transport for sale. </p> <p> 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specimens must be legally acquired. </p> <p> 10.&nbsp; There are two types of personally owned or possessed specimens that could be considered personal and household effects. These are: (1) Personal effects &ndash; specimens that, at the time of import, export or re-export, were worn, carried or included in personal baggage; or (2) Household effects &ndash; specimens that, at the time of import, export or re-export, were part of a household move. </p> <p> Types of specimens that may be considered as &lsquo;personal and household effects&rsquo; </p> <p> 11.&nbsp; There are several categories of specimens which under certain conditions, can be exempted as personal and household effects (such as personally owned items, tourist souvenirs or hunting trophies). </p> <p> 12.&nbsp; Personally owned or possessed specimens are Appendix-I, -II or -III specimens that have been acquired while a person resides in his country of usual residence. There are many different ways in which a specimen may be acquired as long as the acquisition was in accordance with domestic law. Examples include, but are not limited to: </p> <blockquote> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct removal from the wild in the person&rsquo;s country of usual residence; </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a gift acquired within the country of usual residence or imported under CITES provisions from another country; </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an inheritance acquired either within the country of usual residence or imported under CITES provisions from another country; </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchase from a vendor who has either obtained the specimen legally from within the country of usual residence or who has imported the specimens under CITES provisions from another country; and </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A souvenir acquired while travelling abroad and imported either under the personal and household effects exemption or with the appropriate CITES documents; </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hunting trophy that has been legally hunted abroad and imported either under the personal and household effects exemption or with the appropriate CITES documents. </p> </blockquote> <p> 13.&nbsp; Personally owned or possessed specimens will be exempted as personal effects if both the countries of import and export implement the personal and household effects exemption for the species and the specimen at the time of import, export or re-export was worn, carried or included in personal baggage. </p> <p> 14.&nbsp; Personally owned or possessed specimens will be exempted as household effects if both the countries of import and export implement the personal and household effects exemption for the species and the specimen at the time of import, export or re-export was part of a household move. </p> <p> 15.&nbsp; Tourist souvenirs are Appendix-II or -III specimens acquired while travelling abroad. They will be exempted as personal effects if both the countries of import and export implement the personal and household effects exemption for the species and the specimens at the time of import, export or re-export were worn, carried or included in personal baggage. </p> <p> 16.&nbsp; Hunting trophies are Appendix II or III specimens that meet the definition of &lsquo;hunting trophy&rsquo; in Resolution 12.3 (Rev. CoP16). They will be exempted as personal effects if both the countries of import and export implement the personal and household effects exemption for the species and the specimen at the time of import, export or re-export was worn, carried or included in personal baggage. Note that the export or re-export of rhino horn and elephant ivory contained in hunting trophies does not qualify for the personal and household effects exemption. </p> <p> 17.&nbsp; Where a commodity (typically consisting of multiple pieces, such as a pair of shoes or a pair of earrings), such as jewellery or leather goods, is composed of multiple pieces of protected specimens and other items, it should be treated as one specimen. </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> <hr/> <p> <strong> Annex 2&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p class=\"mbc\"> Guidelines for amending the list of personal and household effects of Appendix-II species with quantitative limits </p> <p> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any proposal for adding to, deleting from or otherwise amending the list of personal and household effects of Appendix-II species with quantitative limits, including the quantitative limit set, should be initiated by a Party. </p> <p> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposal should contain supporting information and a justification, including an indication of whether the proposal is being made primarily for enforcement or conservation purposes. </p> <p> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parties should make every effort not to lengthen unnecessarily the list of personal and household effects with quantitative limits. </p> <p> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In support of such proposals submitted to the Parties to the Conference of the Parties for discussion and decision, it is recommended that the following information be contained in any such proposal: </p> <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an assessment of the impact of the proposal, drawn from consultations with range States, producer countries and consumer countries; and </p> <p> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an assessment of the enforceability of the proposal. </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> <p> <img height=\"1\" src=\"../../../I/grey_dot.gif\" width=\"220\"/> </p> <p> <a href=\"#0\"> * </a> <a name=\"FN0\"> </a> <span class=\"footnote\"> Amended at the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties, corrected by the Secretariat following the 15th meeting, and further amended at the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties </span> <!-- end #milieu --> </p></div>",

New Delhi, 1981; Fort Lauderdale, 1994), and Resolution Conf.&nbsp;2.7 (Rev.), adopted at its second meeting and amended at its ninth meeting; </p> <p> RECALLING the determination of the Contracting States that international cooperation is essential for the protection of certain species of wild fauna and flora against over-exploitation through international trade; </p> <p> CONSIDERING that, for marine species, Article&nbsp;XV, paragraph&nbsp;2&nbsp;(b), of the Convention requires the Secretariat to consult inter-governmental bodies having a function in relation to those species; </p> <p> NOTING that, in accordance with the recommendations of the special working session of the Conference of the Parties (Geneva, 1977), the Secretariat has requested and obtained observer status, and adviser status for trade matters, at meetings of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and at meetings of the Scientific Committee of the IWC; </p> <p> NOTING further that the IWC has requested and obtained observer status at meetings of the Conference of the Parties; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING that Article&nbsp;III, paragraph&nbsp;5, and Article&nbsp;IV, paragraph&nbsp;6, of the Convention prohibit the transportation into a party State of specimens (including any readily recognizable parts or derivative thereof) of any species listed in Appendix&nbsp;I or II to the Convention that were taken in the marine environment not under the jurisdiction of any States without prior grant of a certificate from a Management Authority of the State of introduction; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING that the jurisdiction of the Parties with respect to marine resources in their adjacent seas is not uniform in extent, varies in nature and has not yet been agreed internationally; </p> <p> DESIRING that the maximum protection possible under this Convention be afforded to the cetaceans listed in the Appendices; </p> <p> CONSIDERING that the International Whaling Commission has asked for the support of the Parties in protecting certain stocks and species of whales; </p> <p> MINDFUL of the need for special attention to the conservation of whales and other cetaceans; </p> <p> RECALLING that commercial utilization has caused the rapid depletion of many species and stocks of large whales once they become the focus of exploitation and has resulted in a threat to the survival of a number of these species and stocks; </p> <p> OBSERVING that any commercial utilization of species and stocks protected by the IWC jeopardizes their continued existence, and that trade in specimens of these species and stocks must be subject to particularly strict regulation in order not to endanger further their survival; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING that although these species and stocks of whales are protected from commercial whaling by nationals of IWC member nations, they are commercially harvested by nationals of non-IWC member nations and that such harvesting circumvents and diminishes the effectiveness of the protective regime of the IWC and threatens to prevent the recovery of those protected species and stocks; </p> <p> NOTING that some unknown level of exploitation of whales may be occurring outside the control of the IWC; </p> <p> RECALLING also that the great whales have not generally recovered from the depletion brought about by commercial exploitation, even though many other species of exploited wildlife have recovered from equal or greater degrees of depletion; </p> <p> NOTING that the IWC has taken increasingly vigorous action to provide for the effective conservation and management of whales which are of interest to all nations of the world by establishing limits on the number of whales that may be taken by nationals of its member nations; </p> <p> NOTING that the IWC has established regulations that protect certain species and stocks from all commercial whaling by nationals of its member nations in order to provide them with protection and the opportunity to recover from over-exploitation; </p> <p> WELCOMING the Resolution passed by the IWC at its Special Meeting in December 1978 requesting that the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, at its second meeting, take all possible measures to support the IWC ban on commercial whaling for certain species and stocks of whales;

</p> <p> CONCERNED that the international trade in meat and other products of whales is lacking adequate international monitoring or control; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING that the IWC is the major source of information on whale stocks around the world; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING further that the meat and other products of such protected species of whales are subject to international trade which cannot be controlled effectively by the IWC alone; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING further the need for the IWC and CITES to cooperate and exchange information on international trade in whale products; </p> <p> AFFIRMING its concern that any illegal international trade in Appendix-I whale specimens undermines the effectiveness of both the IWC and CITES; </p> <p align=\"CENTER\"> <strong> THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE CONVENTION </strong> </p> <b> <i> <p> Regarding adhesion to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling </p> </i> </b> <p> RECOMMENDS that those Parties that do not currently adhere to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling be encouraged to do so;

<p> NOTING that the terms of Resolution Conf.&nbsp;10.16 (Rev.), adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its 10th meeting (Harare, 1997) and amended at its 11th meeting (Gigiri, 2000), do not allow the entry into trade of specimens of species included in Appendix&nbsp;I that have been taken from the wild and reared in captivity, except in accordance with the provisions of Article&nbsp;III of the Convention; <p> RECOGNIZING that some successful programmes for the conservation of certain species permit specimens of those species into international trade on the basis that such trade is no longer detrimental to the survival of their wild populations; <p> RECALLING Resolution Conf.&nbsp;9.6 (Rev.), adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its ninth meeting (Fort Lauderdale, 1994) and amended at its 11th meeting (Gigiri, 2000), which recommends that Parties consider all products of ranching operations to be readily recognizable; <p> RECOGNIZING that marking of parts and derivatives in trade from ranched animals is necessary to achieve adequate control; <p> RECOGNIZING that, if each Party establishes a different marking system for parts and derivatives of ranched animals of the same species, confusion will result and enforcement will be difficult; <p> BELIEVING that any proposal to transfer to Appendix&nbsp;II, for ranching, a species for which such a proposal has previously been approved should be consistent with the approved proposal in its intent and in the terms and conditions it specifies; <p> RECOGNIZING that, in accordance with Article&nbsp;XIV of the Convention, Parties may adopt more restrictive domestic controls on trade in specimens of populations included in the Appendices; <p> CONSIDERING the necessity of transferring populations back to Appendix&nbsp;I if it is established that ranching operations utilizing them no longer meet the criteria; <p> AWARE that ranching of crocodilians on the basis of controlled collection of eggs or hatchlings can be potentially a valuable and positive conservation tool, whereas taking of wild adult animals needs stricter control; <p> RECOGNIZING that as a management system, ranching for some species has proven to be a &lsquo;safe&rsquo; and robust form of sustainable utilization relative to wild harvests of adults; <p> CONSCIOUS of the danger of providing greater incentives for the establishment of captive-breeding operations, which may damage efforts to conserve wild populations, than for ranching operations, which in principle are more beneficial to crocodilian conservation; </p> EMPHASIZING that the overriding objective of the Convention is to conserve wild populations of the species listed in the Appendices and that positive incentives must be offered to programmes designed to achieve this aim; <p align=\"CENTER\"> <b> THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE CONVENTION </b> </p> <p class=\"bold_i\"> Regarding definitions </p> <p> DECIDES that: <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the term &lsquo;ranching&rsquo; means the rearing in a controlled environment of animals taken as eggs or juveniles from the wild, where they would otherwise have had a very low probability of surviving to adulthood; and </p> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the term &lsquo;uniform marking system&rsquo; means a system of marking each product approved by the Conference of the Parties for a species, which, as a minimum, includes the International Organization for Standardization two-letter code for the country of origin, a unique identification number and the year of production or, for products in stock or manufactured from products of the operation in stock at the time of the proposal, the year of approval of the proposal; <p class=\"bold_i\"> Regarding proposals to transfer populations from Appendix&nbsp;I to Appendix&nbsp;II for ranching </p> <p> RECOMMENDS that: <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; populations of species included in Appendix&nbsp;I that occur within the jurisdiction of Parties and are deemed by the Conference of the Parties to be no longer endangered and to benefit by ranching with the intention of trade be included in Appendix&nbsp;II; <p> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in order to be considered by the Conference of the Parties, any proposal to transfer a population to Appendix&nbsp;II in order to conduct a ranching programme satisfy the following general criteria: <p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"900\"> <tr> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"3%\"> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"3%\"> i) <td colspan=\"3\"> the programme must be primarily beneficial to the conservation of the local population (i.e., where applicable, contribute to its increase in the wild or promote protection of the species's habitat while maintaining a stable population);

in order to be discussed at the next meeting of the Conference of the Parties, any proposal for amendment of the Appendices pursuant to this Resolution be received by the Secretariat at least 330 days before that meeting. In consultation with the Animals Committee, the Secretariat shall seek appropriate scientific and technical advice to verify that the criteria specified in paragraph d) above under RECOMMENDS have been met and to review the information and assurances in the proposal that are specified in paragraph b) above. If in the opinion of the Secretariat further information concerning the criteria is required, the Secretariat shall request information from the proposing Party within 150 days after receipt. Thereafter, the Secretariat shall communicate with the Parties in accordance with Article&nbsp;XV of the Convention; and </p> f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proposals that include a component of a wild-adult harvest be examined much more stringently than those based purely on collection of eggs, neonates, larvae or other juvenile life stages; <p> <em> <strong> Regarding changes to the ranching programme described in the proposal to transfer a species from Appendix I to Appendix II </strong> </em> <p> RECOMMENDS that: <p> a)Parties achieving or having achieved the transfer of their populations of a species to Appendix II under the provisions of this Resolution limit the manner of exploitation of wild populations to those techniques described in their proposals and not, for example, later initiate new short-term programmes for taking wild animals without notifying the Secretariat; <p> b)any Party with an approved ranching proposal submit any changes to the information supplied in paragraph c) above under RECOMMENDS to the Secretariat. The Secretariat, in consultation with the Animals Committee, should determine whether the changes proposed substantially alter the original ranching programme, and undermine or jeopardize the conservation of the wild population. The Secretariat should advise the Party of its determination accordingly; and <p> c)in cases where the Secretariat, in consultation with the Animals Committee, concludes that changes to the ranching programme that are proposed in accordance with paragraph h) would result in substantial changes to management of the species, the proposed management be treated as a new proposal, requiring the submission of a proposal pursuant to this Resolution and to the requirements of Article XV of the Convention; <p class=\"bold_i\"> Regarding trade in ranched specimens of species transferred from Appendix&nbsp;I to Appendix&nbsp;II </p> <p> RECOMMENDS that all Parties prohibit trade in products of ranching operations unless such trade complies with all the terms, conditions and requirements of the approved ranching proposal for the population concerned; and </p> <p class=\"bold_i\"> Regarding monitoring and reporting in relation to species transferred from Appendix&nbsp;I to Appendix&nbsp;II for ranching </p> <p> RECOMMENDS that: <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; annual reports on all relevant aspects of each approved ranching operation be submitted to the Secretariat by the Party concerned, including the following: <p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"900\"> <tr> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"3%\"> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"3%\"> i) <td colspan=\"3\"> the status of the wild population concerned established by monitoring at an appropriate frequency and with sufficient precision to allow recognition of changes in population size and structure owing to ranching; </td> </td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\"> <td valign=\"top\"> ii) <td colspan=\"3\"> the number of specimens (eggs, young or adults) taken annually from the wild and the percentage of this offtake used to supply ranching operations; and </td> </td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\"> <td valign=\"top\"> iii) <td colspan=\"3\"> details of the annual production levels, and product types and quantity produced for export; </td> </td> </td> </tr> </table> <p> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the following information should be maintained by the Party and made available to the Secretariat upon request: <p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"900\"> <tr> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"3%\"> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"3%\"> i) <td colspan=\"3\"> an estimate of the percentage of the annual wild production of eggs, neonates or other life stages taken for the ranching operation; </td> </td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\"> <td valign=\"top\"> ii) <td colspan=\"3\"> the number of animals released and their survival rates estimated on the basis of surveys and tagging programmes, if any; </td> </td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\"> <td valign=\"top\"> iii) <td colspan=\"3\"> the mortality rate in captivity and causes of such mortality; </td> </td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\"> <td valign=\"top\"> iv)&nbsp; <td colspan=\"3\"> conservation programmes and scientific experiments carried out in relation to the ranching operation or the wild population concerned; and </td> </td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\"> <td valign=\"top\"> v) <td colspan=\"3\"> an estimation of the percentage of the distribution area of the species where the ranching is operating; </td> </td> </td> </tr> </table> <p> c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the consent of the Standing Committee and the Party concerned, the Secretariat should have the option to visit and examine a ranching operation wherever circumstances require it to do so; and <p> d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where the Secretariat reports failure to comply with this Resolution, and the Standing Committee and the Party concerned fail to resolve the matter satisfactorily, the Standing Committee may, after full consultation with the Party concerned, request the Depositary Government to prepare a proposal to transfer the population concerned back to Appendix&nbsp;I; and <p> REPEALS the Resolutions listed hereunder: <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolution Conf.&nbsp;5.16 (Rev.)

Within the confines of the law, the ultimate decision on disposal of confiscated animals must achieve three goals: 1) to maximize conservation value of the specimens without in any way endangering the health, behavioural repertoire, or conservation status of wild or captive populations of the species <a href=\"#fn1\"> <sup> 1 </sup> </a> <a name=\"1\"> </a> ; 2) to discourage further illegal or irregular trade in the species; and 3) to provide a humane solution, whether this involves maintaining the animals in captivity, returning them to the wild, or employing euthanasia to destroy them. </p> <p> <b> Statement of need </b> </p> <p> Increased regulation of trade in wild plants and animals and enforcement of these regulations has resulted in an increase in the number of wildlife shipments intercepted by government authorities as a result of non-compliance with these regulations. In some instances, the interception is a result of patently illegal trade; in others, it is in response to other irregularities, such as insufficient or incomplete paperwork from the exporting country or poor packing that has compromised the welfare of the live animals in the shipment. While in some cases the number of animals in a confiscated shipment is small, in many others the number is in the hundreds. Although, in many countries, confiscated animals have usually been donated to zoos or aquaria, this option is proving less viable with large numbers of animals and, increasingly, common species. The international zoo community has recognized that placing animals of low conservation priority in limited cage space may benefit those individuals but may also detract from conservation efforts as a whole. They are, therefore, setting conservation priorities for cage space. <p> In light of these trends, there is an increasing demand &ndash; and urgent need &ndash; for information and advice to guide confiscating authorities in the disposal of live animals. Although specific guidelines have been formulated for certain groups of organisms, such as parrots and primates, no general guidelines exist. <p> When disposing of confiscated animals, authorities must adhere to national, regional and international law. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) requires that confiscated individuals of species listed in the treaty's Appendices be returned to the &ldquo;State of export... or to a rescue centre or such other place as the Management Authority deems appropriate and consistent with the purpose of the Convention&rdquo; (Article&nbsp;VIII). However, the treaty does not elaborate on this requirement, and CITES Management Authorities must act according to their own interpretation, not only with respect to repatriation but also as regards what constitutes disposal that is &ldquo;appropriate and consistent&rdquo; with the treaty. Although the present guidelines are intended to assist CITES Management Authorities in making this assessment, they are designed to be of general applicability to all confiscated live animals. <p> The lack of specific guidelines has resulted in confiscated animals being disposed of in a variety of ways, many inconsistent with conservation objectives. In some cases, release of confiscated animals into existing wild populations has been done after careful evaluation and with due regard for existing guidelines. In other cases, such releases have not been well planned. Poorly planned releases of confiscated animals may doom these animals to a slow, painful death. Such releases may also have strong negative conservation value by threatening existing wild populations. Threats to existing populations can take several forms: 1)&nbsp;diseases and parasites acquired by the released animals while held in captivity may spread into existing wild populations; 2)&nbsp;individuals released into existing populations, or in areas near to existing populations, may not be of the same race or subspecies as those in the wild population, resulting in mixing of distinct genetic lineages; 3)&nbsp;animals held in captivity, particularly juveniles and immatures, may acquire an inappropriate behavioural repertoire from individuals of other related species. Release of these animals could result in inter-specific hybridization. </p> Disposal of confiscated animals is not a simple process. Only on rare occasions will such disposal be straightforward or result in an action with conservation value. Options for disposal of confiscated animals have thus far been influenced by the perception that returning animals to the wild is the optimal solution in terms of both animal welfare and conservation. A growing body of scientific study of reintroduction of captive animals suggests that such actions may be among the least appropriate options for many reasons. This recognition requires that the options available to confiscating authorities for disposal of the animals be carefully reviewed. <p> <b> Management options </b> </p> <p> In deciding on the disposal of confiscated animals, managers must ensure both the humane treatment of the animals and the conservation and welfare of existing wild populations of the species involved. Options for disposal fall into three principal categories: 1)&nbsp;maintenance of the individuals in captivity; 2)&nbsp;returning the individuals in question to some form of life in the wild; and 3)&nbsp;euthanasia. The last option may often prove the most appropriate and most humane. </p> Within a conservation perspective, by far the most important consideration in reviewing the options for disposal is the conservation status of the species concerned. For confiscated animals of endangered or threatened species, particular effort should be directed towards evaluating whether and how these animals might contribute to a conservation programme for the species. The decision as to which option to employ in the disposal of confiscated animals will depend on various legal, social, economic and biological factors. The &ldquo;Decision Tree&rdquo; provided in the present guidelines is intended to facilitate consideration of these options. The tree has been written so that it may be used for both threatened and common species, although it is recognized that the conservation status of the species will be the primary consideration affecting whether or not confiscated animals might be valuable to an active conservation breeding/reintroduction programme, and whether or not local or international agencies will be willing to make an investment in expensive and difficult tasks such as genetic determination of country of origin and site of capture or the establishment of reintroduction, benign introductions, or reinforcement of extant wild populations. International networks of experts, such as the IUCN-Species Survival Commission Specialist Groups, should be able to assist confiscating authorities, and CITES Scientific and Management Authorities, in their deliberations as to the appropriate disposal of confiscated specimens. <p> <b> OPTION 1 - CAPTIVITY </b> </p> <p> Confiscated animals are already in captivity; there are numerous options for maintaining them in captivity. Depending on the circumstances, animals can be donated, loaned or sold. Placement may be in zoos or other facilities, or with private individuals. Finally, placement may be in the country of origin, the country of export (if different), the country of confiscation, or a country with adequate and/or specialized facilities for the species in question. If animals are maintained in captivity, in preference to either being returned to the wild or destroyed, they must be afforded humane conditions and ensured proper care for their natural lives. <p> Zoological gardens, aquaria and safari parks are the captive facilities most commonly considered for disposal of animals, but a variety of other captive situations exist. These include the following: <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u> Rescue centres </u> , established specifically to treat injured or confiscated animals, are sponsored by a number of humane organizations in many countries. <p> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u> Lifetime-care facilities </u> devoted to the care of confiscated animals have been built in a few countries. <p> c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u> Specialist societies </u> or clubs devoted to the study and care of single taxa or species (e.g. reptiles, amphibians, birds) have, in some instances, provided an avenue for the disposal of confiscated animals without involving sale through intermediaries. <p> d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u> Humane societies </u> may be willing to ensure placement of confiscated specimens with private individuals who can provide humane lifetime care. <p> e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u> Universities and research laboratories </u> maintain collections of exotic animals for many kinds of research (e.g. behavioural, ecological, physiological, psychological, medical). Attitudes towards vivisection, or even towards the non-invasive use of animals in research laboratories as captive study populations, vary widely from country to country. Whether transfer of confiscated animals to research institutions is appropriate will therefore engender some debate, although transfer to an establishment that conducts research under humane conditions may offer an alternative, and one which may eventually contribute information relevant to the species' conservation. In many cases, the lack of known provenance, and the potential that the animal in question has been exposed to unknown pathogens will make transfer to a research institution an option unlikely to be exercised or desired. <p> f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u> Sale </u> of confiscated specimens to traders, commercial captive breeders, or others involved in commercial activities can provide a means of disposal that helps offset the costs of confiscation. However, sale should only be considered in certain circumstances, such as where the animals in question are not threatened and not subject to a legal prohibition on trade (e.g. CITES Appendix&nbsp;II) and there is no risk of stimulating further illegal or irregular trade. Sale to commercial captive breeders may contribute to reducing the demand for wild-caught individuals. At the same time, however, it may prove to be a poor option owing to the risk of creating a public perception of the State's perpetuating or benefiting from illegal or irregular trade. Finally, confiscating authorities should be aware that, unless specific legal provisions apply, it is impossible to assure the welfare of the animals following placement. </p> Where animals are transferred by the confiscating authority but not sold, ownership should be specified as one of the terms and conditions of the transfer. Where the country of origin desires return of the animals, this desire should be respected. The custodian (zoo, welfare organization) of confiscated animals should only move the animals to another facility for legitimate humane and propagation purposes with the authorization of the administrative authority. <p> <em> <strong> Captivity &ndash; Benefits and disadvantages </strong> </em> <p> The benefits of placing confiscated animals in a facility that will provide lifetime care under humane conditions include: <p> a)educational value; <p> b)potential for captive breeding for eventual reintroduction; and <p> c)possibility for the confiscating authority to recover, from sale, the costs of confiscation. <p> The disadvantages of placing animals in a facility not involved in an established programme for captive breeding and reintroduction include the following: <p> a)Potential to encourage undesired trade. Some authors have maintained that any transfer &ndash; whether commercial or non-commercial &ndash; of confiscated animals risks promoting a market for these species and creating a perception of the State's being involved in illegal or irregular trade. <p> BirdLife International suggests that in certain circumstances sale of confiscated animals does not necessarily promote undesired trade. They offer the following requirements that must be met in order for sale by the confiscating authority to be permitted: 1) the species to be sold is already available in the confiscating country in commercial quantities; and 2) wildlife traders under indictment for, or convicted of, crimes related to import of wildlife are prevented from purchasing the animals in question. Experience in selling confiscated animals in the United States suggests that it is virtually impossible to ensure that commercial dealers implicated or suspected of being implicated in illegal or irregular trade are not involved, directly or indirectly, in purchasing confiscated animals. This suggests that confiscation results in increased costs but is not necessarily a disincentive as regards the practices or problems that gave rise to confiscation. <p> Placing threatened species into commercial trade should not be considered because of the risks of stimulating unwanted trade. Appendix I species may be sold to a registered commercial breeding facility for Appendix I species, but these specimens should not be resold or enter commercial trade. As captive-bred offspring of Appendix I species are deemed to be specimens of species included in Appendix II, there is the potential for commercial breeders to breed animals in captivity to replace wild-caught animals as a source for trade. Hence sale, in certain circumstances (e.g. to commercial captive breeders), may have a clearer potential for the conservation of the species than non-commercial disposal or euthanasia. Such breeding programmes must be carefully assessed and approached with caution. It may be difficult to monitor these programmes and such programmes may unintentionally, or intentionally, stimulate trade in wild animals. <p> It is essential that confiscating authorities recognize that there are many threatened species that are not included in the CITES Appendices but may require the same treatment as CITES Appendix I species. <p> b)Cost of placement. While any payment will place a value on an animal, there is no evidence that trade would be encouraged if the institution receiving a donation of confiscated animals were to reimburse the confiscating authority for costs of care and transport. However, payments should be kept to a minimum and, where possible, the facility receiving the animals should bear all costs directly. <p> c)Disease. Confiscated animals may serve as vectors for disease and, therefore, must be subject to extremely stringent quarantine. The potential consequences of the introduction of alien disease to a captive facility are as serious as those of introducing disease to wild populations. <p> d)Captive animals can escape from captivity and become pests. Accidental introduction of exotic species can cause tremendous damage and in certain cases, such as the escape of mink Mustela vison from fur farms in the United Kingdom, the introduction of exotics can result from importation of animals for captive breeding. <p> <b> OPTION 2 - RETURN TO THE WILD </b> </p> <p> Although CITES requires that repatriation of confiscated CITES-listed animals to the country of export be considered as an option for disposal by a confiscating authority, the treaty in no way requires that animals be returned to the wild in that country. These guidelines suggest that return to the wild would be a desirable option in a very small number of instances and under very specific circumstances. Repatriation to avoid addressing the question of disposal of confiscated animals is irresponsible. When considering repatriation, the confiscating authority must ensure that the recipients of the animals are fully cognizant of the ramifications of repatriation and the options for disposal, as set forth in these guidelines. Furthermore, the country returning an animal to its country of origin for release must ensure that the Management Authority in the country of origin is aware of the return. </p> <p> The rationale behind many of the decision options in this section is discussed in greater detail in the IUCN Guidelines for Reintroduction. It is important to note that these Guidelines make a clear distinction between the different options for returning animals to the wild. These are elaborated on the next page. </p> <p> a) <u> Reintroduction </u> : an attempt to establish a population in an area that was once part of the range of the species but where it has become extinct. </p> <p> Some of the best known reintroductions have been of species that were extinct in the wild. Examples include: P&egrave;re David's deer <i> Elaphurus davidianus </i> and the Arabian oryx <i> Oryx leucoryx </i> . Other reintroduction programmes have involved species that existed in some parts of their historical range but that had been eliminated from other areas; the aim of these programmes is to re-establish a population in an area, or region, from which the species has disappeared. An example of this type of reintroduction is the recent reintroduction of the swift fox <i> Vulpes velox </i> in Canada. </p> <p> b) <u> Reinforcement of an existing population </u> : the addition of individuals to an existing population of the same taxon. </p> <p> Reinforcement can be a powerful conservation tool when natural populations are diminished by a process which, at least in theory, can be reversed. An example of a successful reinforcement project is that involving the golden lion tamarin <i> Leontopithecus rosalia </i> in Brazil. Habitat loss, coupled with capture of live animals for pets, resulted in a rapid decline of the golden lion tamarin. When reserves were expanded, and capture for the pet trade curbed, captive golden lion tamarins were then used to supplement depleted wild populations. </p> <p> Reinforcement has been most commonly pursued when individual animals injured by human activity have been provided with veterinary care and released. Such activities are common in many western countries, and specific programmes exist for species as diverse as hedgehogs, Erinaceinae, and birds of prey. However common an activity, reinforcement carries with it the very grave risk that individuals held in captivity, even temporarily, are potential vectors for disease back into a wild population. </p> <p> Because of inherent disease risks, reinforcement should only be employed in instances where there is a direct and measurable conservation benefit (demographically or genetically), as when reinforcement is critical for the viability of the wild population into which an individual is being placed. </p> <p> <em> <strong> &ldquo;Return to the wild&rdquo; &ndash; Concerns and benefits </strong> </em> </p> <p> Before &ldquo;Return to the wild&rdquo; of confiscated animals is considered, several issues of concern must be considered in general terms: welfare, conservation value, cost and disease. <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u> Welfare </u> . While return to the wild may appear to be humane, it may be nothing more than a sentence to a slow death. Humane considerations require that each effort to return confiscated animals to nature be thoroughly researched and carefully planned. Such returns also require long-term commitment in terms of monitoring the fate of released individuals. Some authors have advocated that the survival prospects for released animals must at least approximate those for wild animals of the same sex and age class in order for return to the wild to be seriously considered. While such demographic data on wild populations are, unfortunately, rarely available, the spirit of this suggestion should be respected; there must be humane treatment of confiscated animals when attempting to return them to the wild. <p> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u> Conservation value and cost </u> . In cases where returning confiscated animals to the wild appears to be the most humane option, such action can only be undertaken if it does not threaten existing populations of wild plants and animals or the ecological integrity of the area in which they live. The conservation of the species as a whole, and of other animals already living free, must take precedence over the welfare of individual animals that are already in captivity. <p> Before animals are used in programmes in which existing populations are reinforced, or new populations are established, it must be determined that returning these individuals to the wild will make a significant contribution to the conservation of the species. Larger populations are less likely to become extinct, hence reinforcing existing very small wild populations may reduce the probability of extinction. In very small populations a lack of males or females may result in reduced population growth or in population decline. Reinforcing a very small population lacking animals of a particular sex may also improve prospects for survival of that population. <p> It should be noted that where confiscated individuals are used for reintroduction (as defined above) they will form the nucleus of a new population. If such a programme is to be successful, a relatively large number of individuals will be required. Hence, small groups of confiscated animals may be inappropriate for reintroduction programmes. <p> The cost of returning animals to the wild in an appropriate manner can be prohibitive for all but the most endangered species. The species for which the conservation benefits clearly outweigh these costs represent a tiny proportion of the species listed in the CITES Appendices, although it includes numerous species not regulated under CITES. In the majority of cases, the costs of appropriate, responsible reintroduction will preclude return to the wild. Poorly planned or executed reintroduction programmes are the equivalent of dumping animals in the wild and should be vigorously opposed on both conservation and humane grounds. <p> c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u> Source of individuals </u> . If the country of origin and site of capture of the animals is not known, or if there is any question of the source of the animals, supplementation may lead to inadvertent pollution of distinct genetic races or subspecies. If particular local races or subspecies show specific adaptation to the local environment, mixing in animals from other races or subspecies may be damaging to the local population. Introducing an animal into the wrong habitat type may also doom it to death. <p> d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u> Disease </u> . Animals held in captivity and/or transported, even for a very short time, may be exposed to a variety of pathogens. Release of these animals into the wild may result in introduction of disease to conspecifics or unrelated species with potentially catastrophic effects. Even if there is a very small risk that confiscated animals have been infected by exotic pathogens, the potential effects of introduced diseases on wild populations are so great that this will often preclude returning confiscated animals to the wild. <p> Where confiscated animals are found to be unsuitable for return to the wild, disease screening and appropriate quarantine are, nevertheless, essential in order to ensure that they are free of disease, or that diseases and parasites harboured by these animals are found in the captive population to which the animals may be transferred. Introduced diseases can be dangerous to captive facilities, particularly in zoos where infection across different species in a collection is a serious threat. Where such quarantine can not ensure that an individual is healthy, isolation for an indefinite period or euthanasia must be carried out. <p> There are clearly instances where return to the wild of confiscated animals must be considered an option for disposal. First and foremost, the question to be addressed is: will returning the animals to the wild make a significant contribution to the conservation of the species in question? Release into the wild of any animal that has been held in captivity is risky. While some diseases can be tested for, tests do not exist for many animal diseases. Furthermore, animals held in captivity are frequently exposed to diseases not usually encountered in their natural habitat. Veterinarians and quarantine officers, thinking that the species in question is only susceptible to certain diseases, may not test for these diseases picked up in captivity. <p> Given that any release incurs some risk, we must adopt the following &lsquo;precautionary principle&rsquo;: if there is no conservation value in releasing confiscated specimens, the possibility of accidentally introducing into the environment a disease that is not already present, however unlikely, will rule out returning confiscated specimens to the wild. <p> There are several <em> benefits </em> of returning animals to the wild, either through reintroduction or reinforcement of an existing population. <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In situations where the existing population is severely threatened, such an action might improve the long-term conservation potential of the species as a whole, or of a local population of the species (e.g. golden lion tamarins). </p> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning animals to the wild makes a strong political/educational statement concerning the fate of the animals (e.g. orangutans <em> Pongo pygmaeus </em> and chimpanzees <em> Pan troglodytes </em> ) and may serve to promote local conservation values. However, as part of any education or public awareness programme, the costs and difficulties associated with return to the wild must be emphasized. <p> <b> OPTION 3 - EUTHANASIA </b> </p> <p> Euthanasia &ndash; the killing of animals carried out according to humane guidelines &ndash; is unlikely to be a popular option amongst confiscating authorities for disposal of confiscated animals. However, it can not be overstressed that euthanasia may frequently be the simplest and most humane option available. In many cases, authorities confiscating live animals will encounter the following situations. <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return to the wild in some manner is either unnecessary (e.g. in the case of a very common species), impossible, or prohibitively expensive as a result of the need to conform to biological and animal welfare guidelines. <p> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Placement in a captive facility is impossible, or there are serious concerns that sale will be problematic or controversial. <p> c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During transport, or while held in captivity, the animals have contracted a chronic disease that is incurable and, therefore, a risk to any captive or wild population. <p> Euthanasia has several clear advantages. <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the point of view of conservation of the species involved, and of protection of existing captive and wild populations of animals, euthanasia carries far fewer risks when compared to returning animals to the wild. <p> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Euthanasia will also act to discourage the activities that gave rise to confiscation, be it smuggling or other patently illegal trade, inadequate paperwork, poor packing, or other problems, as the animals in question are removed entirely from trade. <p> c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Euthanasia may be in the best interest of the welfare of the confiscated animals. Unless adequate finances are available for reinforcement of existing populations or reintroduction, release to the wild will carry enormous risks for existing wild populations and severely jeopardize the survival prospects of the individual animals, which may, as a result, die of starvation, disease or predation. </p> d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When animals are destroyed, or when they die a natural death while in captivity, the dead specimens should be placed in the collection of a natural history museum, or another reference collection in a university or research institute. Such reference collections are of great importance for studies of biodiversity. If such placement is impossible, carcasses should be incinerated to avoid illegal trade in animal parts or derivatives. <b> <i> <p align=\"CENTER\"> DECISION TREE ANALYSIS </p> </i> </b> <p> For decision trees dealing with &ldquo;Return to the wild&rdquo; and &ldquo;Captive&rdquo; options, the confiscating Party must first ask the question: </p> <p> <b> Question 1:Will returning the animal to the wild make a significant contribution to the conservation of the species, including through education and other means? </b> </p> The most important consideration in deciding on disposal of confiscated specimens is the conservation of the species in question. Because there can never be absolute certainty that a confiscated animal is free of diseases and parasites, returning to the wild an individual that has been held in captivity will always involve some level of risk to existing populations of the same or other species in the ecosystem to which the animal is returned. <p> Where releasing confiscated animals to the wild appears to be the most humane action, it must improve the prospects for survival of the existing wild population. Humanitarian and conservation interests are best served by ensuring the survival of as many individuals as possible, not just the short-term comfort of a few individuals. The benefits of the return in terms of conservation value must clearly outweigh the potential risks. </p> In most instances, the benefits of return to the wild will be outweighed by the costs and risks of such an action. If returning animals to the wild is not of conservation value, &ldquo;Captive&rdquo; options pose fewer risks and may offer more humane alternatives. <p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"900\"> <tr> <td width=\"62\"> <b> Answer: </b> </td> <td width=\"814\"> Yes:Investigate \"Return to the wild\" options. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> No:Investigate \"Captive\" options. </td> </tr> </table> <b> <i> <p align=\"CENTER\"> DECISION TREE ANALYSIS - CAPTIVITY </p> </i> </b> <p> The decision to maintain confiscated animals in captivity involves a simpler set of considerations than does the decision to return them to the wild. It should be noted that the order in which options are placed in the present decision tree is not necessarily the most appropriate for all authorities in all countries: it is expected that each confiscating authority will determine which option is most appropriate based on the particular case and its particular situation. </p> <p> <b> Question 2:Have animals been found to be disease-free by comprehensive veterinary screening and quarantine? </b> </p> Because of the risk of introducing disease to captive populations, animals that may be transferred to certified captive facilities must have a clean bill of health. If confiscated animals are not found to be healthy they must be placed in quarantine before being transferred or the facility to which they are transferred must have adequate quarantine facilities. If, during quarantine, the animals are found to harbour diseases that can not be cured, they must be destroyed to prevent infection of other animals. <p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"900\"> <tr> <td width=\"62\"> <b> Answer: </b> </td> <td width=\"814\"> Yes:Proceed to Question 3. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> No:Quarantine; re-assess question 2 after quarantine. </td> </tr> </table> <p> If chronic and incurable infection, first offer animals to research institutions.

When a choice must be made between several such institutions, the paramount consideration should be which facility can provide the most consistent care and ensure the welfare of the animals. The terms and conditions of the transfer should be agreed between the confiscating authority and the recipient institution. Terms and conditions for such agreements should include: </p> <p> a)a clear commitment to ensure lifetime care or, in the event that this becomes impossible, transfer to another facility that can ensure lifetime care, or euthanasia; </p> <p> b)exclusion from resale of the animals involved; and </p> <p> c)clear specification of ownership of the specimens concerned and, where breeding may occur, the offspring.

Animals should not be held by the confiscating authority indefinitely while such programmes are planned, but should be transferred to a holding facility after consultation with the organization that is establishing the new programme. <p> <strong> Answer: </strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes:&nbsp; Transfer to holding facility or new programme. <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No:&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursue &ldquo;Captive&rdquo; options. </p> <p align=\"CENTER\"> <a href=\"../../res/10/10-07fig1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Decision tree for &ldquo;Captive&rdquo; options </a> </p> <p align=\"CENTER\"> <a href=\"../../res/10/10-07fig2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Decision tree for &ldquo;Return to the wild&rdquo; options </a> </p> <hr align=\"center\" color=\"#009900\" size=\"1\"> <p> <b> Annex 2 </b> </p> <p align=\"CENTER\"> <b> CITES guidelines for the disposal of confiscated live plants </b> </p> <p> These Guidelines are addressed to authorities in countries of origin and countries of import. When government authorities seize and subsequently confiscate live plants, these authorities have a responsibility to dispose of them appropriately. In the case of importing countries, the country of origin and/or export of the plants will normally first be contacted and notified of the seizure. Within the confines of the law, the ultimate decision on disposal of confiscated plants must achieve three goals: </p> <p> a)to maximize conservation value of the specimens without in any way endangering the genetic integrity or conservation status of wild or cultivated populations of the taxon (species, subspecies, etc.); </p> <p> b)to discourage further illegal or irregular trade in the taxon; and </p> <p> c)to avoid the resources used by organizations involved in their care or disposal being diverted away from other equally important conservation activities. </p> <b> Statement of need </b> </hr> </p> <p> Increased regulation of trade in wild plants and animals and enforcement of these regulations have resulted in an increase in the number of wildlife shipments intercepted by government authorities as a result of non-compliance with these regulations. In some instances, the interception is a result of patently illegal trade; in others, it is in response to other irregularities, such as insufficient or incomplete paperwork from the exporting country or poor packing of the shipment. Whilst in some cases the number of plants in a seized shipment is small, in many others the number is in the hundreds or thousands. Although, in many countries, confiscated plants have been donated to botanic gardens or other publicly managed living plant collections, this option is proving less viable with large numbers of poorly documented plants and common species of artificially propagated horticultural origin. </p> <p> In light of these trends, there is an increasing demand - and urgent need - for information and advice to guide CITES authorities in the disposal of live plants. Although the options available have been discussed for certain groups of plants, such as cycads, no general guidelines exist. </p> <p> When disposing of confiscated plants, authorities must adhere to national, regional and international law. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) requires that confiscated live specimens of taxa listed in the treaty&rsquo;s Appendices be returned to the \"State of export ... or to a rescue centre or such other place as the Management Authority deems appropriate and consistent with the purpose of the Convention\" (Article&nbsp;VIII). However, the treaty does not elaborate on this requirement, and CITES Management Authorities must act according to their own interpretation, not only with respect to repatriation but also as regards what constitutes disposal that is &lsquo;appropriate and consistent&rsquo; with the treaty. Although the present guidelines are intended to assist CITES Management Authorities in making this assessment, they are designed to be of general applicability to all confiscated live plants. </p> <p> The lack of specific guidelines has resulted in confiscated plants being disposed of in a variety of ways, many inconsistent with conservation objectives. While, in some cases, replanting of confiscated plants into existing wild populations has been done after careful evaluation and with due regard for existing guidelines, in others, such releases have not been well planned. Such releases may have a strong negative conservation value by threatening existing wild populations. Threats to existing populations can take different forms: </p> <p> a)diseases and parasites acquired by the released plants while held on horticultural premises may spread into existing wild populations; and </p> <p> b)specimens planted amongst existing populations, or in areas near to existing populations, may not be of the same race or subspecies as those in the wild population, resulting in mixing of distinct genetic lineages. </p> Until recently disposal of confiscated plants has meant either long term care in a botanic garden or transfer to a secure nursery for the purpose of artificial propagation in an attempt to lessen the demand for the species from wild sources. </p> <p> <b> Management options </b> </p> <p> Within a conservation perspective, by far the most important consideration in reviewing the options for disposal is the conservation status of the species concerned. For confiscated plants of endangered or threatened taxa, particular effort should be directed towards evaluating whether and how these plants might contribute to a conservation programme for the taxon concerned. The decision as to which option to employ in the disposal of confiscated plants will depend on various legal, economic and biological factors. The &lsquo;Decision Tree Analysis&rsquo; provided in the present guidelines is intended to facilitate consideration of these options. The tree has been written so that it may be used for both threatened and common taxa, although it is recognized that the conservation status of the taxa will be the primary consideration affecting whether or not confiscated plants might be of value to an active conservation propagation/reintroduction programme, and whether or not local or international agencies will be willing to make an investment in expensive and difficult tasks such as genetic determination of country of origin and site of collection, the establishment of reintroduction programmes, or reinforcement of extant wild populations. International networks of experts, such as the IUCN/Species Survival Commission&rsquo;s Specialist Groups, Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) and the International Association of Botanic Gardens (IABG), should be able to assist confiscating authorities and CITES Scientific and Management Authorities in their deliberations as to the appropriate disposal of confiscated specimens. Confiscated plants, whether destined for long term maintenance at horticultural premises or eventual reintroduction into the wild, should first be made available to propagation centres in the country of origin, if these exist and are willing to accept the consignment. </p> <p> <b> OPTION 1 - MAINTENANCE IN CULTIVATION </b> </p> <p> Seized plants are usually maintained in publicly managed horticultural establishments pending a decision on confiscation; subsequently there are numerous options for their maintenance. Placement may be in the country of origin, the country of export (if different), the country of confiscation, or a country with adequate and/or specialized facilities for the taxa in question. Depending on the circumstances and national laws, plants can be donated, loaned or sold. Final placement may be in botanic gardens or other publicly managed facilities, or with private organizations/individuals. </p> <p> Placement options include: </p> <p> a) <u> Botanic gardens and other publicly managed facilities </u> , which are those that have mostly been used to date (and which in some cases are reaching the limit of capacity, placing in jeopardy their ability to carry out other <i> ex situ </i> conservation activities). </p> <p> b) <u> Universities and research laboratories </u> , which maintain living botanical collections for many kinds of research and teaching purposes (e.g. molecular systematics, anatomy, cytogenetics, reproductive biology, etc). Whether transfer of confiscated plants to research institutions is appropriate will depend on the likelihood that research carried out may eventually contribute information relevant to the species&rsquo; conservation. In some cases, the lack of known provenance will make transfer to a research institution an option unlikely to be exercised or desired. Depending on the nature of the research being carried out it may also be important to establish written agreements protecting the rights of the country of origin of the plants concerned in line with the Convention on Biological Diversity. </p> <p> c) <u> Specialist societies </u> or clubs devoted to the study and care of particular plant groups (e.g. succulent plants), which could, in some instances, provide an avenue for the disposal of confiscated plants without involving sale through intermediaries. However, care must be taken to ensure that such organizations do not include persons trading in wild-collected specimens. </p> <p> d) <u> Sale </u> of confiscated specimens to traders, commercial propagators or others involved in commercial activities, which can provide a means of disposal that helps offset the costs of confiscation, especially in the case of large consignments of artificially propagated material. However, sale should not be considered unless the plants in question have been legally collected in the country of origin, are not going to be exploited in contravention of the Convention on Biological Diversity, are not subject to a legal prohibition on trade and there is no risk of stimulating further illegal or irregular trade. Sale to commercial propagators may contribute to reducing the demand for wild-collected specimens. At the same time, however, it may prove to be a poor option owing to the risk of creating a public perception of the State&rsquo;s perpetuating or benefiting from illegal (unlicensed) or irregular trade. </p> Where plants are transferred by the confiscating authority but not sold, ownership by the Management Authority should be specified as one of the terms and conditions of the transfer. Where the country of origin may desire return of the plants, this desire should be respected, so long as the condition of the plants is such that they will survive the return voyage. The custodian (botanic garden or other organization) of confiscated plants should only move confiscated stocks to another facility for legitimate propagation purposes with the authorization of the administrative authority. <p> <b> \"Maintain in cultivation\" - Benefits and disadvantages </b> </p> <p> The <i> benefits </i> of placing confiscated plants in a facility that will provide a satisfactory standard of horticultural care include: </p> <p> a)educational value; </p> <p> b)potential for propagation for eventual reintroduction and/or to satisfy consumer demand for artificially propagated specimens; and </p> <p> c)potential to carry out genetic fingerprinting and other molecular studies contributing to a better understanding of the population genetics and therefore conservation status of the taxa concerned. </p> The <i> disadvantages </i> of placing plants in a facility not involved in an established programme for artificial propagation and reintroduction include the following: </p> <p> a) <u> The risk of encouraging illegal trade unless </u> : </p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"900\"> <tr> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"3%\"> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"3%\"> i) <td colspan=\"3\"> the species to be sold is already available in the confiscating country in commercial quantities or as legally traded wild-collected specimens; and </td> </td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> ii) </td> <td> wildlife traders under indictment for, or convicted of, crimes related to import of wildlife are prevented from obtaining the specimens in question. </td> </tr> </table> <p> Placing threatened taxa into commercial trade should not be considered because of the risks of stimulating unwanted trade. Appendix-I taxa may be sold to a nursery registered under CITES for the propagation of Appendix-I taxa, but the confiscated specimens themselves should not be resold or enter commercial trade. Since artificially propagated offspring of Appendix-I taxa are deemed to be specimens of species included in Appendix-II, there is the potential for commercial growers to propagate specimens to replace wild-collected plants as a source for trade. Hence the loan or sale, in certain circumstances (e.g. to commercial nurseries) may have a higher potential for the conservation of the species than non-commercial disposal or destruction. Such propagation activities must be carefully assessed and approached with caution, since they may be difficult to monitor. </p> <p> It is essential that confiscating authorities recognize that there may be threatened plant taxa that are not currently included in CITES Appendix&nbsp;I but may, nevertheless, warrant the same treatment. </p> <p> b) <u> Cost of placement </u> . While seized plants are being maintained pending a decision on confiscation, the facility providing care for the plants may have its expenses reimbursed by the importer, airline carrier and/or the confiscating authority. Upon confiscation, if the plants are sold to a commercial organization, any payment received by the CITES authorities will place a value on such specimens. However, there is no evidence that trade would be encouraged if a commercial trader were to reimburse costs of care and transport. </p> <p> c) <u> Disease </u> . Confiscated plants may serve as vectors for disease and, therefore, must be subject to proper quarantine inspection. The potential consequences of the introduction of alien disease to a horticultural establishment are as serious as those of introducing disease to wild populations. </p> <p> d) <u> Risk of escape </u> . Plants can escape from horticultural control and become deleterious weeds. Accidental introduction of exotic species can cause tremendous damage and certain countries have strict legislation aimed at limiting the risks of this happening. </p> <b> OPTION 2 - RETURN TO THE WILD </b> </p> <p> Although CITES requires that repatriation of confiscated CITES-listed plants to the country of export be considered as an option for disposal by a confiscating authority, the treaty in no way requires that plants be returned to the wild in that country. These guidelines suggest that return to the wild would be a desirable option only in certain circumstances. Repatriation to avoid addressing the question of disposal of confiscated plants is irresponsible. When considering repatriation, the confiscating authority must ensure that the recipients of the plants are fully cognizant of the ramifications of repatriation and the options for disposal, as set forth in these Guidelines. Furthermore, the country returning a plant to its country of origin must ensure that the Management Authority in the country of origin is aware of the return and welcomes it. </p> <p> The rationale behind many of the decision options in this section is discussed in greater detail in the IUCN Guidelines for Reintroduction (IUCN/SSC Reintroduction Specialist Group, IUCN, 1995). It is important to note that these Guidelines make a clear distinction between the different options for returning organisms to the wild. These are elaborated below. </p> <p> a) <u> Reintroduction </u> : an attempt to establish a population in an area that was once part of the range of the species but where it has become extinct. </p> <p> Some of the best known reintroductions involving plants have been of taxa that were extinct in the wild. Other reintroduction programmes have involved taxa that existed in some parts of their historical range but that had been eliminated from other areas; the aim of such programmes being to re-establish a population in an area, or region, from which the species has disappeared. </p> <p> b) <u> Reinforcement of an existing population </u> : the addition of specimens to an existing population of the same taxon. </p> <p> Reinforcement can be a powerful conservation tool when natural populations are diminished by a process which, at least in theory, can be reversed. </p> <p> Because of inherent disease risks, reinforcement should only be employed in instances where there is a direct and measurable conservation benefit (demographically or genetically), as when reinforcement is critical for the viability of the wild population into which a specimen is being placed. </p> <b> \"Return to the wild\" - Concerns and benefits </b> </p> <p> Before \"Return to the wild\" of confiscated plants is contemplated, several issues of concern must be considered in general terms: conservation value, cost, source of specimens and disease. </p> <p> a) <u> Conservation value and cost </u> . In cases where returning confiscated plants to the wild appears to be feasible, such action can only be undertaken if it does not threaten existing populations of wild plants and animals or the ecological integrity of the area in which they live. The conservation of the taxon as a whole, and of other organisms already living free, must take precedence over the welfare of specimens that are already in cultivation. </p> <p> b) <u> Source of specimens </u> . If the country of origin and site of collection of plants is not known, or if there is any question of their source, supplementation may lead to inadvertent pollution of distinct genetic races or subspecies. </p> <p> c) <u> Disease </u> . Plants maintained in cultivation and/or transported, even for a very short time, may be exposed to a variety of pathogens. Release of these plants into the wild may result in introduction of disease to conspecific or unrelated species with potentially catastrophic effects. Even if there is a very small risk that confiscated plants have been infected by exotic or common horticultural pathogens, the potential effects of introduced diseases on wild populations are so great that this will often preclude returning confiscated plants to the wild. </p> <p> Where confiscated plants are judged unsuitable for return to the wild, disease screening and appropriate quarantine are, nevertheless, essential (and are frequently a legal requirement) in order to ensure that they are free of disease, or that diseases and parasites harboured by these plants are already present in the cultivated population to which the specimens may be transferred. Introduced diseases can be a serious threat to horticultural establishments. Where such quarantine can not provide a reasonable level of certainty that a specimen is healthy, isolation for an indefinite period or destruction of the confiscated specimens must be carried out. </p> <p> Clearly, there are instances where return to the wild of confiscated plants must be considered an option for disposal. First and foremost, the question to be addressed is: will returning the plants to the wild make a significant contribution to the conservation of the taxon in question? Release into the wild of any plant that has been held in horticultural premises is risky. While some diseases can be tested for, tests do not exist for all plant diseases. Furthermore, plants held in horticultural premises are frequently exposed to diseases not usually encountered in their natural habitat. </p> <p> Given that any release incurs some risk, we must adopt the following &lsquo;precautionary principle&rsquo;: if there is no conservation value in releasing confiscated specimens, the possibility of accidentally introducing into the environment a disease that is not already present, however unlikely, will rule out returning confiscated specimens to the wild. </p> There are certain benefits of returning plants to the wild, either through reintroduction or reinforcement of an existing population. </p> <p> a)In situations where the existing population is severely threatened, such an action might improve the long-term conservation potential of the taxon as a whole, or of a local population of the taxon. </p> <p> b)Returning plants to the wild makes a strong political/educational statement concerning their fate and may serve to promote local conservation values. However, as part of any education or public awareness programme, the costs and difficulties associated with return to the wild must be emphasized. </p> <b> OPTION 3 - DESTRUCTION </b> </p> <p> Destruction of plant material of common taxa, poorly documented specimens and/or those of horticultural origin, or of diseased material that will require expensive techniques to rid it of the diseases or pests involved, is clearly a justifiable action, especially when to keep the material in horticultural premises will cause the use of resources better directed to other conservation activities. Destruction of such material, if publicized, will also act to discourage the activities that led to confiscation, e.g. illegal collection (although the plants may be needed in the country of origin as evidence), failure to obtain correct import/export documents, poor packing, etc. In some cases, while it may be impractical to maintain plants in a living state in cultivation, their preservation as herbarium specimens may be desirable, especially if their country and site of origin is adequately documented and technical help for their preparation is available from the recipient herbarium or museum. This applies both to the country where the confiscation took place and to the country of origin, whose institutions may have been denied the right to receive material through illegal collecting. Destruction of material that is well-documented as to its wild provenance should be done only as a last resort when all other options for its disposal have been exhausted. </p> <b> <i> <p align=\"CENTER\"> DECISION TREE ANALYSIS </p> </i> </b> <p> For decision trees dealing with \"Return to the wild\" and \"Maintain in cultivation\" options, the confiscating Party, in discussion with the CITES authorities in the country of origin (if appropriate), must first ask the question: </p> <p> <b> Question 1:Will returning the plant to the wild make a significant contribution to the conservation of the taxon, including through education and other means? </b> </p> The most important consideration in deciding on disposal of confiscated specimens is the conservation of the taxon in question. Because there can never be absolute certainty that a confiscated plant is free of pests and diseases, returning to the wild a specimen that has been held on horticultural premises will always involve some level of risk to existing populations of the same or other taxa in the ecosystem to which the plant is returned. </p> <p> Where returning confiscated plants, or their propagations, to the wild appears to be an achievable action, it must improve the prospects for survival of the existing wild population(s). Conservation interests are best served by ensuring the survival of as many specimens as possible, not just the short-term survival of a few specimens. The benefits of the reintroduction in terms of conservation value must clearly outweigh the potential risks. </p> <p> In most instances, the benefits of return to the wild will be outweighed by the costs and risks of such an action. If returning plants to the wild is not of conservation value, maintenance in cultivation in a propagation centre may pose fewer risks and may offer more conservation benefits. </p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"900\"> <tr> <td width=\"62\"> <b> Answer: </b> </td> <td width=\"814\"> Yes:Investigate \"Return to the wild\" options. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> No:Investigate \"Maintain in cultivation\" options. </td> </tr> </table> <b> <i> <p align=\"CENTER\"> DECISION TREE ANALYSIS - MAINTAIN IN CULTIVATION </p> </i> </b> <p> The decision to maintain confiscated plants in cultivation, whether in the country of origin or elsewhere, involves a simpler set of considerations than does the decision to return them to the wild. </p> <p> <b> Question 2:Have plants been subjected to comprehensive plant health screening and quarantine? </b> <p> Plants that may be transferred to horticultural premises must have a clean bill of health because of the risk of introducing disease to cultivated populations. </p> These plants must be placed in quarantine to determine if they are disease-free before being transferred to a propagation centre. </p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"900\"> <tr> <td width=\"62\"> <b> Answer: </b> </td> <td width=\"814\"> Yes:Proceed to Question 3. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> No:Quarantine and screen and move to Question 3. </td> </tr> </table> <p> <b> Question 3:Have plants been found to be disease-free by comprehensive plant health screening and quarantine or can they be treated for any pests and diseases discovered? </b> </p> If, during quarantine, the plants are found to harbour pests that can not be eliminated or diseases that can not reasonably be expected to be cured, they must be destroyed to prevent infection of other plants. If the plants are suspected to have come into contact with diseases for which screening is impossible, extended quarantine, donation to a research facility or destruction must be considered. </p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"900\"> <tr> <td width=\"62\"> <b> Answer: </b> </td> <td width=\"814\"> <p> Yes:Proceed to Question 4. </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> No:If with chronic and incurable infection, first offer plants to research institutions or to herbaria/museums for preservation. If impossible to place in or not required by such institutions, destroy. </td> </tr> </table> <p> <b> Question 4:Are there grounds for concern that sale or donation will stimulate further illegal or irregular trade? </b> </p> Commercial sale of Appendix-I taxa might stimulate trade in these species. Taxa that are not listed in any CITES Appendix but that are nonetheless seriously threatened with extinction should be afforded the same caution. </p> <p> Sale or donation of confiscated plants, where legally permitted, is a difficult option to consider. While the benefits of sale - income and quick disposal - are clear, there are many problems that may arise as a result of further commercial transactions of the specimens involved. Equally, it should be noted that there may be circumstances where problems arise as a result of non-commercial transactions. It should also be noted that sale or donation to commercial nurseries may increase the availability of propagated material, thereby reducing the threats from wild-collection. </p> <p> More often than not, sale of threatened taxa should not take place. Sale of or trade in threatened species may be legally proscribed in some countries, or by CITES. There may be instances where a commercial nursery may purchase or receive specimens for propagation, which may reduce pressure on wild populations subject to trade. In all circumstances, the confiscating authority should be satisfied that: </p> <p> a)those involved in the illegal or irregular transaction that gave rise to confiscation can not obtain the plants; </p> <p> b)the sale or donation does not compromise the objective of confiscation; and </p> <p> c)the sale or donation will not increase illegal, irregular or otherwise undesired trade in the taxon. </p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"900\"> <tr> <td width=\"62\"> <b> Answer: </b> </td> <td width=\"814\"> Yes:Proceed to Question 5a. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> No:Proceed to Question 5b. </td> </tr> </table> <p> <b> Question 5a:Is space available in a botanic garden/ non-commercial propagation centre, whether publicly managed or privately owned? </b> </p> <p> <b> Question 5b:Is space available in a botanic garden/ non-commercial propagation centre, whether publicly managed or privately owned, or is there a commercial facility propagating this taxon, and is it interested in the plants? </b> </p> Transfer of plants to non-commercial propagation facilities, if their sale, donation or loan may stimulate further illegal or irregular trade, or to commercial propagation facilities, an option only if sale/donation/loan will not stimulate further illegal or irregular trade, should generally provide a safe and acceptable means of disposal of confiscated plants. When a choice must be made between several such institutions, the paramount consideration should be which facility can: </p> <p> a)offer the opportunity for the plants to be used in a programme of propagation; and </p> <p> b)provide the most consistent care without compromising the resources available for other equally valuable conservation activities in which it is engaged. </p> The terms and conditions of the transfer should be agreed between the confiscating authority and the recipient institution. Terms and conditions for such agreements should include: </p> <p> a)a clear commitment to ensure indefinite care to an acceptable standard or, in the event that this becomes impossible, transfer to another facility that can ensure such care; </p> <p> b)a clear specification of ownership of the specimens concerned (as determined by national law) and, where propagation may occur, the offspring. Depending on the circumstances, ownership may be vested with the confiscating authority, the country of origin or export, or with the recipient facility; and </p> <p> c)a clear specification of conditions under which the plants, or any plants propagated from them, may be sold. </p> <p> In the majority of instances, there will be limited facilities available in the country in which plants are confiscated. Where this is the case other horticultural options should be investigated. This could include transfer to a propagation centre outside the country of confiscation and ideally in the country of origin, or, if it will not stimulate further illegal trade, placement in a commercial propagation facility. However, such propagation programmes must be carefully assessed and approached with caution, bearing in mind the restraints implied by the Convention on Biological Diversity. It may be difficult to monitor these programmes and such programmes may unintentionally stimulate trade in wild-collected plants. The conservation potential of transfer to a commercial propagation facility, or loan for propagation, must be carefully weighed against even the smallest risk of stimulating trade that would further endanger the wild population of the taxon. </p> <p> In many countries, there are active specialist societies or clubs of individuals with considerable expertise in the care and propagation of particular plant groups in trade. Such organizations can assist in finding homes for confiscated plants without involving sale through intermediaries. In this case, individuals receiving confiscated plants must have demonstrated expertise in the cultivation of the taxa concerned and must be provided with adequate information and advice by the relevant club or society. Transfer to specialist societies or individual members must be made according to terms and conditions agreed with the confiscating authority. Placement with these societies or members is an option if sale or donation of the confiscated plants may or may not stimulate trade. </p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"900\"> <tr> <td width=\"62\"> <b> Answer: </b> </td> <td width=\"814\"> Yes:Execute agreement and sell/donate/loan. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> No:Proceed to Question 6. </td> </tr> </table> <p> <b> Question 6:Are institutions interested in plants for research as museums specimens? </b> </p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"900\"> <tr> <td width=\"62\"> <b> Answer: </b> </td> <td width=\"814\"> <p> Yes:Execute agreement and transfer. </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> No:Destroy. </td> </tr> </table> <b> <i> <p align=\"CENTER\"> DECISION TREE ANALYSIS - RETURN TO THE WILD </p> </i> </b> <p> <b> Question 2:Have plants been subjected to comprehensive plant health screening and quarantine? </b> </p> Because of the risk of introducing disease to wild populations, plants that may be reintroduced must have a clean bill of health.

Introduction </em> </strong> </p> <p> In order to monitor and record levels of illegal trade in ivory and other elephant specimens on a global basis, there is a need for a system to collect and compile law enforcement data on seizures and confiscations. At its 10th meeting, the Conference of the Parties recognized the Bad Ivory Database System (BIDS) established by TRAFFIC for this purpose in 1992. </p> <p> Through further development and refinement, BIDS evolved into the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS), which has been used to monitor the pattern and scale of illegal trade in ivory and other elephant specimens since 1998. </p> <p> <strong> <em> 2.&nbsp; Scope </em> </strong> </p> <p> ETIS is a comprehensive and global information system whose central feature is a database holding the details of law enforcement records for seizures or confiscations of elephant ivory and other elephant specimens which have been reported to occur since 1989. ETIS also maintains a series of subsidiary information on law enforcement effort and efficiency, rates of reporting, legal and illegal elephant product markets, governance issues, background economic data and other factors. </p> <p> <strong> <em> 3.&nbsp; Methods </em> </strong> </p> <p> Data and information on illegal trade in elephant ivory and other elephant specimens will be collected by TRAFFIC in collaboration with the CITES Secretariat. In this regard, a standardized methodology has been developed for the collection of data, including, <em> inter alia </em> and to the extent known: </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source of information </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; date of seizure </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agency responsible for seizure </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type of transaction </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; country of seizure </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; country of origin </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; country of export </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; country of destination/import </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type of ivory and quantity </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mode of transport </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em> modus operandi </em> </p> <p> &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nationality of suspects </p> <p> Standardized data are collected through a number of mechanisms and formats, including direct online data submission to the ETIS website, using the ETIS Data Collection Form for individual seizure cases or the ETIS Data Collection Spreadsheet for reporting multiple seizure cases at one time. Reporting on elephant product seizures or confiscations using other formats is also acceptable. </p> <p> <strong> <em> 4.&nbsp; Data collection and compilation </em> </strong> </p> <p> The MIKE and ETIS Technical Advisory Group (TAG) will support the development and implementation of ETIS. ETIS will be managed and coordinated by TRAFFIC in consultation with the TAG and in collaboration with the CITES Secretariat. </p> <p> All Parties, through their CITES Management Authorities, following liaison with appropriate law enforcement agencies, should provide information on seizures and confiscations of ivory or other elephant specimens in the prescribed formats either to the Secretariat or directly to TRAFFIC within 90 days of their occurrence. In addition, law enforcement agencies in States not-party to the Convention are requested to provide similar information. </p> <p> TRAFFIC will assist the Parties in collecting data, ensuring data quality and consistency, and providing tools and training in data collection, data utilization and information management to designated officials around the world as appropriate. </p> <p> <strong> <em> 5.&nbsp; Data analysis and interpretation </em> </strong> </p> <p> The analysis and interpretation of data will be coordinated by TRAFFIC in association with the CITES Secretariat and MIKE (see Annex&nbsp;2), and in consultation with the relevant Parties and the TAG. </p> <p> <strong> <em> 6.&nbsp; Reporting </em> </strong> </p> <p> TRAFFIC, in collaboration with the CITES Secretariat, will produce a comprehensive analytical report with full explanatory and interpretive notes prior to each meeting of the Conference of the Parties, and provide other reports, updates or information on ETIS as required by the Conference of the Parties, the Standing Committee, the TAG or Parties. </p> <p> The CITES Secretariat will report on information collected through ETIS and the ETIS analysis at relevant meetings of the Standing Committee and at each meeting of the Conference of the Parties. </p> <p> <strong> <em> 7.&nbsp; Intersessional remedial action </em> </strong> </p> <p> In the event that there is a need for urgent intersessional action, TRAFFIC will report as appropriate to the Standing Committee via the Secretariat. </p> <p> <strong> <em> 8.&nbsp; Funding </em> </strong> </p> <p> A funding mechanism will be established to ensure that ETIS is fully operational. </p> <b> <hr> </hr> </b> <p> <b> Annex 2 </b> </p> <p align=\"center\"> <b> Monitoring of illegal hunting in elephant range States </b> </p> <p> <strong> <em> 1.&nbsp; Introduction </em> </strong> </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to address the concerns of many elephant range States, a system has been established to monitor trends in levels of illegal killing of elephants and to elucidate factors associated with such trends. The system, Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE), relies on a simple, standardized protocol for national and international reporting of incidents of illegal killing of elephants, from which levels and trends, and factors associated with these trends can be established, and changes in these levels, trends and factors can be detected. </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such measurement consists of two elements. The first of these is the monitoring of parameters relevant to the issue, such as the pattern and scale of illegal killing of elephants, the pattern and scale of illegal trade in ivory, as well as the effort and resources being applied to detection and/or prevention of such instances, and the monetary value of illegally traded ivory. </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second element is the establishment of correlations between relevant parameters, identified above, and decisions of the Conference of the Parties with regard to elephants. Other factors at the site, country and global levels, such as socio-economic data, civil strife, the flow of illegal arms and ammunition, loss of habitat, and drought will also be examined. </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The overall aim of MIKE is to provide information needed for elephant range States and the Parties to CITES to make appropriate management and enforcement decisions, and to build institutional capacity within the range States for the long-term management of their elephant populations by improving their ability to monitor elephant populations, detect changes in levels of illegal killing, use this information to provide more effective law enforcement and strengthen any regulatory measures required to support such enforcement. </p> <p> <strong> <em> 2.&nbsp; Scope and methodology </em> </strong> </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MIKE is based on a standardized methodology for the reporting by designated authorities and for monitoring in specific sites or areas. </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MIKE is implemented by African and Asian elephant range States in coordination and collaboration with the Secretariat and implementing partners. Elephant range States participating in MIKE will appoint national and site focal points, and inform the Secretariat through the MIKE programme or the relevant Management Authorities of their names and contact details, as well as of any changes in such focal points when they occur. Each elephant range State participating in MIKE will also nominate a member in the Subregional Steering Committee that oversees the implementation of MIKE in its subregion and, through the Secretariat, liaises with the Standing Committee. </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relevant databases and standard reporting protocols have been established by the CITES Secretariat and implementing partners in consultation with elephant range States and the MIKE and ETIS Technical Advisory Group (TAG). </p> <p> <strong> <em> 3.&nbsp; Roles and responsibilities </em> </strong> </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elephant range States are primarily responsible for the collection and regular submission of field data as part of their routine biodiversity monitoring activities following the standard formats provided by MIKE. Data collection includes the following topics: </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elephant population data/trends; </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incidence and patterns of illegal killing; and </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; measures of the effort and resources employed in detection and prevention of illegal killing. </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data and information on illegal hunting and illegal trade in ivory will be collected through active communication with range States through the implementation of MIKE and ETIS (see Annex&nbsp;1). </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CITES Secretariat is primarily responsible for the global data compilation, analysis and reporting, but may request or sub-contract technical support from appropriate experts or organizations, with the advice of the TAG, for the coordination of the following activities: </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obtaining and compiling the data and information indicated above, including through active communication with range States; </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selecting sites for monitoring and, as appropriate, expanding the number of sites to the maximum extent; </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; developing and refining a standardized methodology for data collection and analysis; </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facilitating the provision of training to designated officials in countries with selected sites and to CITES Management Authorities of elephant range States; </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; establishing appropriate databases and developing linkages with existing databases containing relevant data for analysis; and </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collating and processing all data and information from all sources identified. </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CITES Secretariat or implementing partners may enter into specific agreements with range States regarding the implementation of MIKE. </p> <p> <strong> <em> 4.&nbsp; Data access and release </em> </strong> </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summaries and the aggregates of data provided to MIKE, and the analyses of such data, will be considered to be in the public domain once they are published on the CITES website. Detailed data on individual elephant mortalities or law enforcement data submitted to MIKE are owned by the range States that provided them. Such data will be accessible to the TAG and the respective range State for review purposes, but will not be released to any third party without the consent of the range State concerned. Data may be released to contractors (e.g. statisticians) under appropriate non-disclosure agreements. </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data on elephant populations will be maintained in databases established by the IUCN/SSC African and Asian Elephant Specialist Groups, to which MIKE will have direct access. Access by and release to third parties will be subject to the relevant data access and release policies of IUCN. </p> <p> <strong> <em> 5.&nbsp; Reporting </em> </strong> </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CITES Secretariat will report on information collected through MIKE and MIKE analyses at each meeting of the Conference of the Parties, and provide other reports, updates or information on MIKE as required by the Conference of the Parties, the Standing Committee, the TAG or Parties. </p> <p> <strong> <em> 6.&nbsp; Funding and operational support </em> </strong> </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Substantial funding <u> is </u> required for deploying and implementing MIKE. It is expected that most of the data collection functions will be absorbed by elephant range States into routine national-level biodiversity monitoring and law enforcement activities, but long-term support will be required to ensure: the continuity and sustainability of national; regional and global coordination; the provision of training and capacity building; and global data compilation, analysis and reporting. In this regard, the CITES Secretariat will maintain existing partnerships and establish new ones as appropriate, such as the existing collaboration with IUCN in support of activities in the field and the provision and compilation of elephant population data. </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> <p> <img height=\"1\" src=\"../../../I/grey_dot.gif\" width=\"220\"> <p> <a href=\"#0\"> <sup> * </sup> </a> <a name=\"FN0\"> </a> <span class=\"footnote\"> Amended at the 11 <sup> th </sup> , 12 <sup> th </sup> , 14 <sup> th </sup> , 15 <sup> th </sup> and 16 <sup> th </sup> meetings of the Conference of the Parties.. </span> </p> <!-- end #milieu --> </img> </p></div>",

</p> <p> AWARE that such information is frequently available from international organizations that have expertise related to timber trade or forest management; <p> RECOGNIZING that parts and derivatives mentioned in the Interpretation of Appendices&nbsp;I, II and&nbsp;III should be clearly defined; <p> EMPHASIZING the need for Parties to report adequately on their annual trade in timber and to use agreed units of measurement; <p> AWARE that unambiguous identification of timber, by its nature, can be a complex procedure, requiring particular expertise; <p> RECOGNIZING that the development of timber identification materials is essential for the effective implementation of the Convention and that the cost of production will be considerable; <p> NOTING that the approach that authorities of some countries have taken, whereby they meet with timber trade groups and enforcement officers and agree to use standard nomenclature for vernacular and corresponding scientific names of timber species, appears to be a useful one; <p> NOTING further that the objective of the Convention is to ensure the conservation of wild fauna and flora for this and future generations through the protection of certain species against over-exploitation through international trade; <p> NOTING also that the Convention can play a positive role in promoting the conservation of animals and plants, including timber species, through trade in accordance with the requirements of Articles III, IV and&nbsp;V of the Convention and through improving trade monitoring for evaluation of biological status and effective enforcement; <p> RECOGNIZING that commercial trade may be beneficial to the conservation of species and ecosystems when carried out at levels that are not detrimental to the survival of the species in question; <p> RECOGNIZING also that Parties have the right to take stricter domestic measures concerning any species included&nbsp; in the Appendices; <p> AWARE that such measures can have effects unrelated to the conservation of listed species and could be taken for purposes not directly related to the purpose for which the species concerned were included in the CITES Appendices; <p> NOTING also that there are misconceptions that inclusion of a species in Appendix&nbsp;II or III represents a ban on trade in that species; <p> RECOGNIZING that such misconceptions can have negative impacts including the prohibition of or restriction on the use of CITES-listed timber species by architects, engineers, commercial businesses and others, and reduced use of such items by consumers; <p> ACKNOWLEDGING that education is an important tool in the effective implementation of the Convention; <p> NOTING that many internationally traded timber species, boreal, temperate and tropical, can be managed on a sustainable basis through the application of appropriate sylvicultural techniques, but that for other timber species such knowledge is currently lacking;

<p> e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that law enforcement cooperation among range and implicated States be increased through the existing international, regional and national law enforcement mechanisms and, where necessary, through the creation of such mechanisms in order to curtail illegal trade in rhinoceros horn; where an implicated State in this Resolution is a State or citizen(s) of a State significantly implicated or involved in legal and/or illegal trade in parts and derivatives; and <p> f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the implicated States, as a matter of priority, to work with all user groups and industries to develop and implement strategies for reducing the use and consumption of rhinoceros parts and derivatives and to report on progress for inclusion into the joint IUCN/TRAFFIC reports;

CoP15) </br> </b> <a href=\"#FN1\"> <sup> 1 </sup> </a> <a name=\"1\"> </a> <p class=\"bold_i\"> <i> <b> 1.Resource management </b> </i> </p> <p> A. <u> Biological information </u> </p> <p> The proposal should provide information on the biology, management and geographic extent of each population that will be affected throughout its range. Geographic extent should be described using sound scientific techniques. Range is defined as all the range States and waters in which the population occurs. </p> <p> The following characteristics of the population of marine turtles that is the subject of the ranching proposal should be detailed: </p> <dir> <p> a) <u> Population distribution </u> . Describe the current (and, if possible, the historical) nesting grounds, feeding areas and migratory range of the population. Nesting areas from which eggs and/or hatchlings are to be taken should be described in detail. </p> <p> b) <u> Population status and trend </u> . Describe the population and its trend using indices of abundance for the different life stages with particular attention to the age/size structure of the population. </p> <p> c) <u> Reproduction </u> . Provide an estimate or calculation of the annual reproductive rate or size of the annual production (e.g. numbers of eggs and/or hatchlings). </p> <p> d) <u> Population mortality </u> . Provide an estimate of hatching success and estimates of human-induced mortalities of the population. </p> </dir> <p> B. <u> National management </u> </p> <p> A prerequisite for approval of a ranching proposal will be the effective implementation of a national management plan for marine turtles. The plan should include: </p> <dir> <p> a) <u> Monitoring </u> . A description of the annual programme to monitor population trends and mortality rates. </p> <p> b) <u> Habitat protection </u> . All important nesting beaches, feeding grounds and other significant habitats should be protected from disruption including development, urbanization and pollution. </p> <p> c) <u> Harvest regulation </u> . Harvesting for ranches should normally be restricted to eggs and/or hatchlings. The annual numbers (and percentage) of eggs and/or hatchlings proposed for removal to the ranch must be specified. The proposed harvest rate should also be presented as a proportion of the natural production of the population being harvested for ranches. </p> <p> d) <u> Protection of the population </u> . Human-induced mortality of marine turtles, such as uncontrolled harvests, incidental catch in fisheries and pollution of habitat should be identified and mechanisms be in place to control such mortalities. </p> <p> e) <u> Rules for stopping harvests </u> . Predetermined threshold values of population trends and changes in status, mortality or habitat should be proposed, the passing of which would automatically trigger the suspension of harvests, and the initiation of additional conservation measures. </p> </dir> <p> C. <u> Regional management </u> </p> <p> Because of the migratory behaviour of marine turtles, that segment of the population occurring within the jurisdiction of any one State can not be considered in isolation. Any management of the population should involve the range States sharing the majority of the population. </p> <p> A Party submitting a ranching proposal shall take the lead in the development and effective implementation of a regional management protocol designed to enhance the conservation of the population. </p> <dir> <p> a)Activities undertaken by the proponent to develop cooperative regional management among the range States sharing the majority of the population should be described. Regional management should entail cooperative mechanisms for: </p> <dir> <p> i)assessment of the conservation status of the population throughout its range and identification of key recruitment areas (e.g. breeding and nesting sites); </p> <p> ii)regular monitoring of population trends, with an assessment of sources of annual mortality, including the impact of the ranching operation; </p> <p> iii)effective protection of important nesting beaches and other essential habitats (e.g. feeding areas); </p> <p> iv)regulating, where necessary, harvests and domestic sale of marine turtle specimens; and </p> <p> v)effective controls, sufficient to prevent the stimulation of illegal trade in products from wild populations. </p> </dir> <p> b)The regional management protocol designed to enhance conservation of the marine turtles in the wild should also document existing conservation legislation and trade controls by range States and provide a forum through which more effective or complementary trade controls, enforcement activities and other conservation measures may be developed. </p> </dir> <p class=\"bold_i\"> <i> <b> 2.Trade controls </b> </i> </p> <p> Proponents must take every reasonable measure to ensure that the trade in products from approved ranches does not stimulate an increase in trade from other sources in a manner detrimental to the survival of the population, other populations or other species of marine turtle, or serve as a cause for such trade. Therefore, before international trade is authorized, the proponent Party should ensure that both it and any country to which the products of the ranching operation are destined have adequate legal frameworks and administrative measures for monitoring and reporting, and adequate local and national enforcement capabilities. In particular each proponent Party must: </p> <dir> <p> a)Agree that exports of marine turtle products derived from the population covered by its proposal will be restricted to those from the ranching operation, in specified amounts (i.e. a quota may be set) that can be met by proposed ranch production. Importing States shall undertake to provide documentation of their domestic laws to regulate the import, re-export, possession, sale, purchase and transport of marine turtles and their parts and derivatives, and the measures taken to control existing stockpiles of such specimens. </p> <p> b)Document its domestic laws and enforcement mechanisms (including those in any territories and overseas political units) that regulate the taking of marine turtles from the wild and the possession, sale, purchase, transport, import and export of marine turtles, and their parts and derivatives. </p> <p> c)Undertake registration of any existing stockpiles of marine turtle parts and derivatives held within its territorial jurisdiction, and instigate marking and control systems to ensure that such items are readily distinguishable from similar items deriving from approved ranches. </p> <p> d)Describe marking and tracking procedures for all parts and derivatives from approved ranches that will allow the unambiguous identification of ranch products, including methods for marking products and packages, packaging types, transport methods, shipping routes, product documentation, secure storage of products, inventory control up to the point of export and specification of the maximum quantities of products (quotas) to be exported annually. </p> </dir> <p class=\"bold_i\"> <i> <b> 3.The ranching operation </b> </i> </p> <p> To satisfy recommendation d) ii) <a href=\"#FN4\"> <sup> 4 </sup> </a> <a name=\"4\"> </a> under the first RECOMMENDS of Resolution Conf.&nbsp;11.16 (Rev.

</p> <p> RECALLING that Article II, paragraph 2&nbsp;(a), provides for the inclusion of species that may become threatened with extinction in Appendix&nbsp;II, in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING that, for the proper implementation of this provision, it is necessary to adopt appropriate criteria, considering both biological and trade factors; </p> <p> RECALLING that Article II, paragraph 2&nbsp;(b), provides only for the inclusion in Appendix II of species that must be subject to regulation in order that trade in specimens of certain species included in Appendix II in accordance with Article II, paragraph 2&nbsp;(a), may be brought under effective control; </p> <p> CONSIDERING, however, that this provision should also apply where there is a need to bring trade in specimens of species included in Appendix&nbsp;I under effective control; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING that the range States of a species subject to an amendment proposal should be consulted by the proponent, or on its behalf by the Secretariat, in accordance with the relevant Resolutions of the Conference of the Parties, and that all Parties shall be consulted by the Secretariat in accordance with Article XV, paragraph 1&nbsp;(a), of the Convention; </p> <p> RECOGNIZING further that, in accordance with the same Article, the Secretariat shall consult intergovernmental bodies having a function in relation to marine species; </p> <p> CONSIDERING that the Secretariat should also consult other intergovernmental bodies having a function in relation to any species subject to a proposal for amendment;

This can also refer to populations or subpopulations, or, for the sake of convenience in certain cases, to &lsquo;stocks&rsquo; as the term is understood in fisheries management. </p> <p> Until now, the Conference of the Parties has interpreted &lsquo;geographically separate populations&rsquo; as populations delimited by geopolitical boundaries, whereas they have rarely used the other option of geographical boundaries. <p> <em> <strong> Affected by trade </strong> </em> <p> A species \"is or may be affected by trade\" if: </p> <p> i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is known to be in trade (using the definition of &lsquo;trade&rsquo; in Article I of the Convention), and that trade has or may have a detrimental impact on the status of the species; or </p> <p> ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is suspected to be in trade, or there is demonstrable potential international demand for the species, that may be detrimental to its survival in the wild. <p> <em> <strong> Area of distribution </strong> </em> <p> The &lsquo;area of distribution&rsquo; of a species is defined as the area contained within the shortest continuous imaginary boundary which can be drawn to encompass all the known, inferred or projected sites of occurrence, excluding cases of vagrancy and introductions outside its natural range (though inferring and projecting area of occurrence should be undertaken carefully, and in a precautionary manner). The area within the imaginary boundary should, however, exclude significant areas where the species does not occur, and so, in defining an area of distribution, account should be taken of discontinuities or disjunctions in the spatial distribution of species. This encompasses the concept of area of occupancy. For migratory species, the area of distribution is the smallest area essential at any stage for the survival of that species (e.g. colonial nesting sites, feeding sites for migratory taxa, etc.). The determination that a species has a restricted area of distribution is taxon-specific and should take into account considerations such as habitat specificity, population density and endemism. <p> <em> <strong> Decline </strong> </em> <p> A &lsquo;decline&rsquo; is a reduction in the abundance, or area of distribution, or area of habitat of a species. The assessment of decline by reference to area of habitat may be more appropriate where there are intrinsic difficulties in measuring the number of individuals. </p> <p> Decline can be expressed in two different ways: (i) the overall long-term extent of decline; or (ii) the recent rate of decline. The long-term extent of decline is the total estimated or inferred percentage reduction from a baseline level of abundance or area of distribution. The recent rate of decline is the percentage change in abundance or area of distribution over a recent time period. The data used to estimate or infer a baseline for extent of decline should extend as far back into the past as possible. </p> <p> <strong> The judgement that a decline is marked is taxon-specific and can be justified by a number of considerations, for example the population dynamics of a related taxonomic group. A general guideline for a marked historical extent of decline is a percentage decline to 5%-30% of the baseline, depending on the biology and productivity of the species. </strong> Productivity is the maximum percentage growth rate of a population. It is a complex function of reproductive biology, fecundity, individual growth rates, natural mortality, age at maturity and longevity. More-productive species tend to have high fecundity, rapid individual growth rates and high turnover of generations. </p> <p> The extremes of 5% and 30% will be applicable to only a relatively small number of species, but some species may even fall outside of these extremes. However, both these figures are presented only as examples, since it is impossible to give numerical values that are applicable to all taxa because of differences in their biology ( <a href=\"#_ftn1\" id=\"_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"> </a> see footnote with respect to application of decline to commercially exploited aquatic species). </p> <p> A general guideline for a marked recent rate of decline is a percentage decline of 50% or more in the last 10 years or three generations, whichever is the longer. If the population is small, a percentage decline of 20% or more in the last 5 years or 2 generations (whichever is the longer) may be more appropriate. However, these figures are presented only as examples, since it is impossible to give numerical values that are applicable to all taxa because of differences in their biology. </p> <p> The historical extent of decline and the recent rate of decline should be considered in conjunction with one another. In general, the higher the historical extent of decline, and the lower the productivity of the species, the more important a given recent rate of decline is. </p> <p> In estimating or inferring the historical extent of decline or the recent rate of decline, all relevant data should be taken into account. A decline need not necessarily be ongoing. If data are available only for a short period and the extent or rate of decline based on these data are cause for concern, the guidelines above (extrapolated as necessary or relevant) should still apply. However, natural fluctuations should not normally count as part of a decline, but an observed decline should not necessarily be considered part of a natural fluctuation unless there is evidence for this. A decline that is the result of legal activities carried out pursuant to a scientifically-based harvesting programme that reduces the population to a planned level, not detrimental to the survival of the species, would not normally be covered by the term &rsquo;decline&rsquo;. <div> <div id=\"ftn1\"> </div> </div> </p> <strong> Application of decline for commercially exploited aquatic species </strong> <p> In marine and large freshwater bodies, a narrower range of 5-20&nbsp;% is deemed to be more appropriate in most cases, with a range of 5-10&nbsp;% being applicable for species with high productivity, 10-15&nbsp;% for species with medium productivity and 15-20&nbsp;% for species with low productivity. Nevertheless some species may fall outside this range. Low productivity is correlated with low mortality rate and high productivity with high mortality. One possible guideline for indexing productivity is the natural mortality rate, with the range 0.2-0.5 per year indicating medium productivity. </p> <p> In general, the historical extent of decline should be the primary criterion for consideration of listing in Appendix&nbsp;I. However, in circumstances where information to estimate the extent of decline is limited, the rate of decline over a recent period could itself still provide some information on the extent of decline. </p> <p> For listing in Appendix&nbsp;II, the historical extent of decline and the recent rate of decline should be considered in conjunction with one another. The higher the historical extent of decline, and the lower the productivity of the species, the more important a given recent rate of decline is. </p> <p> A general guideline for a marked recent rate of decline is the rate of decline that would drive a population down within approximately a 10-year period from the current population level to the historical extent of decline guideline (i.e. 5-20&nbsp;% of baseline for exploited fish species). There should rarely be a need for concern for populations that have exhibited an historical extent of decline of less than 50&nbsp;%, unless the recent rate of decline has been extremely high. </p> <p> Even if a population is not declining appreciably, it could be considered for listing in Appendix&nbsp;II if it is near the extent-of-decline guidelines recommended above for consideration for Appendix-I listing. A range of between 5&nbsp;% and 10&nbsp;% above the relevant extent of decline might be considered as a definition of &lsquo;near&rsquo;, taking due account of the productivity of the species. </p> <p> A recent rate of decline is important only if it is still occurring, or may resume, and is projected to lead to the species reaching the applicable point for that species in the Appendix-I extent-of-decline guidelines within approximately a 10-year period. Otherwise the overall extent of decline is what is important. When sufficient data are available, the recent rate of decline should be calculated over approximately a 10-year period. If fewer data are available, annual rates over a shorter period could be used. If there is evidence of a change in the trend, greater weight should be given to the more recent consistent trend. In most cases, listing would only be considered if the decline were projected to continue. </p> <p> In considering the percentages indicated above, account needs to be taken of taxon- and case-specific biological and other factors that are likely to affect extinction risk. Depending on the biology, patterns of exploitation and area of distribution of the taxon, vulnerability factors (as listed in this Annex) may increase this risk, whereas mitigating factors (e.g. large absolute numbers or refugia) may reduce it. </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p></div>",

In transposing this principle to the term &lsquo;primarily commercial purposes&rsquo;, it is agreed that all uses whose non-commercial aspects do not clearly predominate shall be considered to be primarily commercial in nature, with the result that the import of specimens of Appendix-I species should not be permitted. The burden of proof for showing that the intended use of specimens of Appendix-I species is clearly non-commercial shall rest with the person or entity seeking to import such specimens. </p> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article&nbsp;III, paragraphs&nbsp;3&nbsp;(c) and 5&nbsp;(c), of the Convention concern the intended use of the specimen of an Appendix-I species in the country of import, not the nature of the transaction between the owner of the specimen in the country of export and the recipient in the country of import. It can be assumed that a commercial transaction underlies many of the transfers of specimens of Appendix-I species from the country of export to the country of import. This does not automatically mean, however, that the specimen is to be used for primarily commercial purposes. <p> <hr align=\"center\" color=\"#009900\" size=\"1\"> <p> <b> Annex </b> </p> <p align=\"CENTER\"> <b> Examples </b> </p> <p> The following examples recognize categories of transactions in which the non-commercial aspects may or may not be predominant, depending upon the facts of each situation. The discussions that follow each example provide further guidance in, and criteria for, assessing the actual degree of commerciality on a case-by-case basis. The list is not intended to be exhaustive of situations where an import of specimens of Appendix-I species could be found to be not for primarily commercial purposes: <table border=\"0\" class=\"khaki\" width=\"96%\"> <tr> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"3%\"> &nbsp; </td> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"3%\"> a) </td> <td width=\"1079\"> <u> Purely private use </u> : Article&nbsp;VII, paragraph 3, of the Convention contains special rules for specimens \"that are personal or household effects\". The exception mentioned does not apply when specimens of Appendix-I species are acquired by the new owner outside of his or her country of usual residence and are imported into that country. It can, however, be deduced from this provision that specimens imported for purely private use should not be considered to be for primarily commercial purposes. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> b)&nbsp; </td> <td> <u> Scientific purposes </u> : Article&nbsp;VII, paragraph 6, of the Convention uses the term \"non-commercial loan, donation or exchange between scientists or scientific institutions\". Thus, the Convention acknowledges that scientific purposes may justify a special departure from the Convention's general procedure. The import of specimens of an Appendix-I species may be permitted in those situations where the scientific purpose for such import is clearly predominant, the importer is a scientist or a scientific institution registered or otherwise acknowledged by the Management Authority of the country of import, and the resale or commercial exchange of the specimens, or their exhibit for economic benefit is not the primary intended use. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> c) </td> <td> &nbsp; <u> Education or training </u> : Specimens of Appendix-I species may also be imported by government agencies or non-profit institutions acknowledged by the Management Authority of the country of import for purposes of conservation, education or training. For example, a specimen could be imported primarily to train Customs staff in effective CITES control. Imports of this type would thus be considered permissible. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> d) </td> <td> <u> Biomedical industry </u> : Close scrutiny must be applied to imports of specimens of Appendix-I species in connection with the biomedical industry, with an initial presumption that such imports are commercial. The purpose of the import here would be twofold: to develop products to promote public health and to sell such products, i.e. to make a profit. The latter aspect in this case would usually be considered to be predominant. As a result, imports of this type will most often not be acceptable. However, where the importer makes a clear showing to the Management Authority of the country of import that the sale of products is only incidental to public health research and not for the primary purpose of economic benefit, then such imports could fall within group&nbsp;b) above. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> e) </td> <td> <u> Captive-breeding programmes </u> : Imports of specimens of Appendix-I species for captive-breeding purposes are a special case. Any import of such specimens for captive-breeding purposes should be in accordance with Resolution Conf. 10.16 (Rev.) and must be aimed as a priority at the long-term protection of the affected species, as required in Resolution Conf. 10.16 (Rev.). Some captive-breeding operations sell surplus specimens to underwrite the cost of the captive-breeding programme. Imports under these circumstances could be allowed if any profit made would not inure to the personal economic benefit of a private individual or shareholder. Rather, any profit gained would be used to support the continuation of the captive-breeding programme to the benefit of the Appendix-I species. It should not, therefore, be assumed that imports under such circumstances are inappropriate. As for imports of captive-bred specimens for captive-breeding programmes for commercial purposes, Article&nbsp;VII, paragraphs 4 and 5, eliminate the need to address the &lsquo;primarily commercial purposes&rsquo; requirement in Article&nbsp;III, paragraph&nbsp;3&nbsp;(c). In connection with captive-breeding purposes, it should be noted that, as a general rule, imports must be part of general programmes aimed at the recovery of species and be undertaken with the help of the Parties in whose territory the species originate. The profit that might result should be used to support the continuation of the programme aimed at the recovery of the Appendix-I species. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> &nbsp; </td> <td> f) </td> <td> <u> Imports via professional dealers </u> : A problem occurs with examples b) through e) above if the import is via a professional dealer. In such situations, the import initially serves a commercial purpose and in principle, therefore, should be prohibited under Article&nbsp;III, paragraph&nbsp;3&nbsp;(c), of the Convention. The fact that the dealer states an intention to eventually sell the imported specimen to an undetermined zoo or scientific institution should not change this overall conclusion. In practice, living specimens are generally imported commercially with just this aim in mind. However, imports through a professional dealer by a qualified scientific, educational, zoological or other non-profit organization may be considered acceptable if the ultimate intended use would be for one of the purposes set out in examples b), c) and e) above, and where a binding contract (including a contract conditioned on the granting of permits) for the import and sale of a particular specimen of an Appendix-I species has already been concluded between the professional dealer and the purchasing institution and is presented to the Management Authority of the country of import with the import permit application. The same should apply to example d) if sale is incidental to public health and not for the primary purpose of economic benefit. </td> </tr> </table> <p> If a proposed import of a specimen of an Appendix-I species fits within one of the above examples, all other applicable provisions of the Convention must still be satisfied in order for the import to be acceptable. For example, where the primary purpose for import is scientific study or zoological exhibition, the remaining conditions under Article&nbsp;III, paragraph&nbsp;3 or&nbsp;5, as applicable, must still be met. Thus, it is possible for an import for scientific or zoological exhibition purposes to be inappropriate where such import is found to be detrimental to the survival of the species or where, in the case of live specimens, it is found that the ultimate recipient of the specimens lacks facilities suitably equipped to house and properly care for the specimens. <p> Moreover, in keeping with the provisions of Article&nbsp;II, paragraph&nbsp;1, the import of specimens of Appendix-I species removed from the wild for one of the purposes set forth above should, as a general rule, not be allowed unless the importer has first demonstrated that: <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he has been unable to obtain suitable captive-bred specimens of the same species; <p> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another species not listed in Appendix&nbsp;I could not be utilized for the proposed purpose; and </p> c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the proposed purpose could not be achieved through alternative means. <p> &nbsp; </p> <p> <img height=\"1\" src=\"../../../I/grey_dot.gif\" width=\"220\"/> </p> <p> <a href=\"#0\"> * </a> <a name=\"FN0\"> </a> <span class=\"footnote\"> Amended by the Secretariat in compliance with Decision 14.19 and with the decisions adopted at the 58th meeting of the Standing Committee; and further amended at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties. </span> </p> <!-- end #milieu --> </p> </p> </p> </p> </hr> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p></div>",

</p> <p> c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when drafting a resolution that is intended to treat a subject comprehensively, or to make significant changes in the way in which a subject is dealt with, a Party prepare the draft so that, if adopted, it will replace and repeal all existing Resolutions (or, as appropriate, the relevant paragraphs) on the same subject; </p> <p> d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when drafting resolutions and decisions which require the gathering of information, a Party consider whether such information could be sought via reports required under the provisions of Article VIII, paragraph 7, of the Convention or, if a special report is needed, and generally ensure that the reporting burden is kept to a minimum; </p> <p> e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unless practical considerations dictate otherwise, draft resolutions not include: </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instructions or requests to committees, working groups or the Secretariat, unless they are part of a long-term procedure; </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decisions on the presentation of the Appendices; and </p> <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii)&nbsp;&nbsp; recommendations (or other forms of decision) that will be implemented soon after their adoption and will then be obsolete; </p> <p> f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a general rule, documents submitted for consideration at a meeting of the Conference of the Parties be no more than 12&nbsp;pages in length; and </p> <p> g)&nbsp;&nbsp; when a draft resolution is adopted that merely adds points to the recommendations (or other decisions) in existing Resolutions, or makes minor amendment thereto, the existing Resolutions be replaced by revised versions with the agreed changes; </p> <p> DIRECTS the Secretariat to put the following proposals on the agenda of the next extraordinary meeting of the Conference of the Parties, whenever this may be convened, as amendments to the Convention: </p> <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the provisions of Article XVI, regarding the listing of Appendix-III parts and derivatives, should be brought into line with Convention procedures for Appendices&nbsp;I and II (Article&nbsp;XV); </p> <p> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paragraph 5 of Article XIV should read: &ldquo;Notwithstanding the provisions of Article IV, any export of a specimen&rdquo; etc.; </p> <p> c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paragraphs 3&nbsp;(b) and 5&nbsp;(b) of Article&nbsp;III should include &ldquo;either a Management Authority or a Scientific Authority of the State&rdquo; etc.; </p> <p> d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the adoption of an official text of the Convention in Arabic; and </p> <p> e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; correction of errors of an orthographical nature discovered in the text of the Convention; </p> <p> DIRECTS the Secretariat further: </p> <p> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when revising its publication of current Resolutions after each meeting of the Conference of the Parties, to correct the texts of already existing Resolutions to ensure that all references to other Resolutions are accurate; </p> <p> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to update the Decisions after each meeting of the Conference of the Parties, to contain all the recommendations (or other forms of decision) that are not recorded in Resolutions and that remain in effect. The Decisions shall be sorted according to subject, using the subjects of the Resolutions for guidance, and within the section for each subject they shall be divided according to the body to which they are directed. The Secretariat shall distribute to the Parties a copy of the updated Decisions soon after each meeting of the Conference; and </p> <p> c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when revising the list of current Decisions for the purpose of suggesting amendments, deletions or continuity, the Secretariat shall provide justification of any proposed changes to a Decision at each meeting of the Conference of the Parties; </p> <p> DECIDES that any draft resolutions or decisions submitted for consideration at a meeting of the Conference of the Parties that have budgetary and workload implications for the Secretariat or permanent committees must contain or be accompanied by a budget for the work involved and an indication of the source of funding; and </p> <p> DECIDES further that the recommendations contained in Resolutions and Decisions adopted by the Conference of the Parties shall enter into effect 90 days after the meeting at which they are adopted, unless otherwise specified in the recommendation concerned. </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> <p> <img height=\"1\" src=\"/I/grey_dot.gif\" width=\"280\"/> </p> <p class=\"footnote\"> <sup> <a href=\"#0\"> * </a> <a name=\"FN0\"> </a> </sup> Amended at the 10 <sup> th </sup> , 12 <sup> th </sup> and 13 <sup> th </sup> meetings of the Conference of the Parties; amended by the Secretariat in compliance with Decision 14.19 and with the decisions adopted at the 58 <sup> th </sup> meeting of the Standing Committee; and further amended at the 15 <sup> th </sup> and 16 <sup> th </sup> meetings of the Conference of the Parties. <!-- end #milieu --> </p> </p> </p></div>",

 - alot of table rows without proper close tags - switching to lxml parser from html.parser
 - not it parses the bad table rows but the enxt problem is at lines: 410-415 - it automatically closes <tr> tag after reading the first 3 <td> elements. Search text for:2009/016
 -the cause of this problem is that table gets truncated at this row, when calling beautifulSoup(html, "lxml")
